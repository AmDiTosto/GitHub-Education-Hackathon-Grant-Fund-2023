# Ada Hack
 - **Date: 15th of October 2022, 08:00 - 20:00,** 
 - **Organization: Edinburgh University Hoppers**
 - **Location: Informatics Forum, Edinburgh**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique?
  - As Edinburgh Hoppers, our society is aimed at supporting Gender Minorities in Informatics, so AdaHack focused on gender minorities and how tech could be used to overcome some of their challenges. People of all genders were encouraged to apply and we aimed to create a safe and fair environment for participants to innovate. <br>
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br> 
  - The Programming Society held a workshop on how to perform  sentiment analysis on Tweets. We showed them how to use the Twitter API to scrape/live stream large numbers of tweets. To turn this into numerical data we showed them how to use basic NLP libraries (such as Vader) and to display their results we gave them a brief overview of how to use the python library pandas. MLH hosted a mini event called capture the flag (CTF) using the platform called Snyk which allowed participants to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in their code. This challenge gave them the opportunity to learn how to expose hidden vulnerabilities in a web application using Snyk & honing their cybersecurity skills! <br>
-  How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
    - The GitHub platform was utilized to submit projects, test, version control, and collaboration. <br>

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - Who was the target audience for your event? <br>
    - Target audience for the event were gender minorities in informatics including women, non-binary and transgender people. <br> 
 - What does the diversity breakdown look like? (Include the percentage of hackers who identify as female, non-binary or other) <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
-  Grant would be utilized for food and beverages, such as breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ordered a breakfast set, pizzas, tomato soup, snacks, and drinks to accommodate our participants. The rest of the grant was used to cover surveyors' hourly costs of monitoring the event, which is 20 pounds per hour.

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br> 
  - One of the coolest projects at the event was presented by our overall winner: Twitter solves a Rubik’s cube. The group created a Twitter bot using the Twitter API, Tweepy, which searches through tweets on Twitter for moves and strategies to solve the Rubik’s Cube. 
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
  - Hackers mainly used GitHub as a version control to collaborate with each other for the project. It was also used to test their projects individually and for the hackathon submission.
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
  - The Twitter solves a Rubik’s cube project was unique, as it was aimed to combine two different challenges: HumanEd’s solve a rubik’s cube intermediate challenge and Programming Society’s use the Twitter API to scrape Twitter and present interesting results.

## What’s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
    - We enjoyed our first-time running AdaHack as a completely new committee. We think the event went well, and that participants enjoyed the day and the safe and inclusive environment we created, but we also have identified areas for improvement for next year through feedback forms. We are looking forward to hosting an even better hackathon next year using what we have learned from this event to improve experiences for participants and organizers alike.
- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>
    - Our yearly hackathon takes place around Ada Lovelace Day each year so our future AdaHack in 2023 will occur then, at a similar time to next year
