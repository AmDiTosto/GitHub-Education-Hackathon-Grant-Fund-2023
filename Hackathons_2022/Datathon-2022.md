# Datathon
 - **Event Start - End Dates: October 8-9** 
 - **Organization: Texas A&M / Datathon**
 - **Location: United States, TX, College Station and Virtual**  

## Event Summary

Datathon is the world's first MLH Data Science Hackathon! It is also completely free for both online and in-person participants to come and tackle challenges while enjoying free swag, food, workshops and much more! TAMU Datathon exists to connect the top talent in data science/machine learning with top companies, lower the bar to entry into DS/ML, and encourage collaboration across disciplines. We had several workshops both from companies and student speakers to help get everyone off the ground and started on their projects. We also held several fun side events to keep our hackers awake and engaged including a Smash Brothers tournament, a zumba class, talent show, bingo and midnight boba! We recommended to our participants to use GitHub as a means to collaborate on their projects and maintain revision control throughout their development process. We would help those not familiar with GitHub individually so that they could get some hands-on experience with the tool and be prepared to take on their challenges.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

One of the main goals of Datathon is to get people, from many different academic backgrounds, together to both grow as individuals and as a team by learning from each other. We advertised our event as beginner friendly and open to all majors to encourage first time hackers and non-computer science majors to take their first steps into data science and machine learning.

## Impact of GitHub Grant

The GitHub grant helped fund both our prizes and our catering for the event. This helped bolster interest by having more big ticket items for our challenges and through the ever so loved free food. We are very appreciative of the support of GitHub for keeping our hackers motivated and fed!

## Whatâ€™s Next?

We achieved what we set out to do this year, by providing an opportunity for people to learn more about both data science and machine learning. Our team had a retrospective and will carry these reflections of what went well and what didn't into our next year. This year's Datathon was a success thanks to the support of GitHub and all of our sponsors! We look forward to working alongside both MLH and GitHub again in the future! You can find us @tamudatathon on both Twitter and Instagram! Look forward to the next Datathon in the Fall of 2023!
