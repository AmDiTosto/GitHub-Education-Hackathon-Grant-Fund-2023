# Datathon FME 2022

Datathon FME 2022 was the second edition of the project that started in 2021. It's the only datathon organized by the UPC university, and currently the biggest one in Barcelona. The idea was to organize a weekend-long event where students and early graduates are encouraged to explore, learn and build solutions in the data science domain, while still having fun.

Some other information:

- **Start and end dates of your event**: November 12-13 2022
- **University Name**: Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (School of Mathematics and Statistics)
- **Organization Team**: Associació d'Estudiants de Dades (AED, Data Students Association)
- **Place**: Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
- **Webpage**: https://datathon.cat

## Event Summary

- **What made your hackathon special or unique?** <br>

  The fact that is a datathon (a data-centric hackathon after all) makes our event special and different from other events. For us, being able to celebrate the event in the School of Mathematics and Statistics makes us feel like we are at home and very close to all the participants, as this is a small and cozy place. We hope that all hackers have this feeling too.

- **Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on.** <br>

  We had two talks from sponsoring companies, a cup-stacking competition, a MLH capture the flag event and a Wikipedia race tournament.

- **How was **GitHub** featured at your event?** <br>

  We gave GitHub and Markdown cheatsheets to the hackers as well as some cool stickers.

## Impact of GitHub Grant

- How did you use the grant funds? <br>

  The funds were diluted within the general budget. The main costs we had were meals (3 hot meals + 2 breakfasts + 3 snacks), merch (T-shirts and stickers), and prizes.

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>

  With all the funding we were able to provide all hackers with enough food and one custom-designed T-shirt per person, which were fundamental to having a successful event! 

## Top Projects

The three winner projects are:

1. Metis Business Intelligence
    - **Devpost Page:** https://devpost.com/software/metis-business-intelligence
    - **GitHub Page:** https://github.com/JNADatathon2022/Datathon
    
    They solved the challenge proposed by the sponsor Accenture brilliantly (winning the Accenture challenge), even proposing some approaches to tackle the incoming problems in the area of Supply Chain Resilience. They used their GitHub page as a container for their code, and also as a quick overview. Special points for the clean Readme presentation.

2. Grannys Watch
    - **Devpost Page:** https://devpost.com/software/granny-s-watch
    - **GitHub Page:** https://github.com/datathon-fme-2022/ageing-challenge/tree/main
    - **Online working demo**: https://datathon-fme-2022-ageing-challenge-main-app-4uyvyq.streamlit.app/
    
    The team created a data-driven app for wearables, using GitHub to both host the code and link to the working demo built in Streamlit. They were the winners of the UPC Challenge, and the only winning team focused on software development and UX.

3. Qualcomm Project Team Patata
    - **Devpost Page:** https://devpost.com/software/qualcomm_project
    - **GitHub Page**: https://github.com/AlvaroDIL/Qualcomm-Challenge-Team-Patata
    
    The team proposed an innovative and surprisingly efficient algorithm to tackle the problem presented by Qualcomm. The accuracy and efficiency of their solution surprised our sponsors, who granted them the 1st position in the Qualcomm Challenge. The usage of Github is not the cleanest, but it's impressive anyways considering that the team was composed of people in the 1st year of their bachelor's and that they learned how to use GitHub during the competition.

## What’s Next?

- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>

  The event took place during the weekend of November 12 to 13 at the UPC's Mathematics and Statistics Faculty.

  Saturday morning the sponsors, challenges, and prizes were presented, and after having breakfast (provided by the organization) the teams started to work on their projects.  There were three challenges, two of them from our main sponsors (Accenture and Qualcomm), and the other was prepared by members of the volunteering team. We had lunch in the park inside the faculty and resumed work. During the evening we had a couple of talks from our sponsors, one of them from MLH. Then we had the cup-stacking competition, a mini snack, and the sponsor aisle.

  We had pizza for dinner (a must) and then some people went to their homes to rest, while others slept at the place, some members of the organizing team as well as other hackers stayed up all night. During the night we held the Wikipedia races tournament and also a midnight snack.

  Sunday morning we started to announce how participants had to submit their projects and the deadlines. After having lunch we prepared the rooms and timetables for judging and started the process. After all the projects were presented, another sponsor made a talk while the juries were deliberating. After that, we announced the winners in the closing ceremony.

- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>

  We don't have them yet, but it will probably be mid-November 2023.
