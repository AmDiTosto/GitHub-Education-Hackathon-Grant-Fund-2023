# DurHack 2022.2
 - **19th-20th November 2022** 
 - **Durham University**
 - **County Durham**  

## Event Summary

- DurHack 2022.2 is the flagship hackathon of the Durham University Computing Society. This time, we brought together over 250 hackers from across the UK for an epic weekend full of innovation, collaboration and fun!<br> 
- We had mini-events such as Slideshow Karaoke, cup stacking, the Snyk Mini CTF and even a Mario Kart tournament for anyone staying up late! Our sponsors provided insightful workshops such as an Introduction to Kaggle Competitions, Defeating Android Malware, an Introduction to GraphQL, and more! <br>
- We gave out GitHub swag such as free stickers. Our GitHub campus expert did a GitHub workshop during the event, which was very helpful to less experienced hackers. <br>

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
DurHack has always aimed to be accessible to all and we encourage students to register regardless of their background. This year, we worked closely with DU Women in Tech aiming to encourage more female-identifying students to come to the event. Based on our registration data, over 1/4 of our participants were female-identifying.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White |
|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|---------:|--------:|
|4|12|4|117|188|


### Where were your hackers from?
| Asia Pacific | North America | Europe / UK | Other |

|51|0|320|12|

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Grant was very helpful in allowing us to secure catering for all our hackers. Thanks to the Grant, we were able to buy additional snacks when our supply started to run low after the first day of hacking. When more people stayed at the event over midnight than we expected, the GitHub Grant allowed us to easily purchase an additional 40 pizzas to feed the hungry hackers and staff.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
Thanks to GitHub and MLH, DurHack was a huge success. Despite more people turning up than expected, we were able to provide everyone with what they needed to have an incredible weekend. Moving forward, we want to expand even further, possibly allowing 300 participants and considering a larger venue.

We're looking forward to working with MLH and GitHub again in the future. Find us at @durhackevent on Instagram and Facebook!
