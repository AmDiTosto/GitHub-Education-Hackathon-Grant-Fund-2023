# HACKUIOWA 2022
 - **Start / End Dates:** October 15-16, 2022 
 - **Organizer:** UIHILAB
 - **University:** The University of Iowa
 - **Location:** Iowa City, USA  

## Event Summary

HHACKUIOWA is a 2 day non-stop hackathon, and it was held at the University of Iowa in the heart of downtown Iowa City, USA. The event was open to all university students that have a passion for creating things with technology!  We had mentors who assisted our participants throughout the hackathon, and a great lineup of tech talks. This year, we had more than 350 registrations, and more than 150 active attendees. As always, our participants dedicated themselves to creating great projects by collaborating with their peers. All projects are open-source at Github because it was required to link projects' GitHub repositories to submission pages. This was very helpful in detecting suspicious projects.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

- HACKUIOWA 2022 was open to all university students including grad students and community colleges. 
- Out of 358 people registered through the registration form, there were 79.3% men, 18.4% women, 1.7% prefer not to answer, and 0.6% prefer to self-describe.
 - We did not ask participants what race they identify with, nor which continent they lived in.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Similar to other in-person hackathons, HACKUIOWA provided lots of food and beverages throughout the event. The grant we got from Github was purely used in catering services to offer various dietary options to match the needs of different people. As shown in our post-event survey, our participants were delighted with catering services.
