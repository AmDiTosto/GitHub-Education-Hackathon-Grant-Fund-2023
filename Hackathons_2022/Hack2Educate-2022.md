# Hack2Educate
 - **Event Dates: Nov 11 - 13**  
 - **Organiser: BeyondExams**
 - **India**

## Event Summary

Over 500 hackers with no previous Hackathon experience registered alonside 450+ experienced hackers for Hack2Educate!  
Through fun mini-events, informal networking sessions and insightful mentorship connects, we created a delightful, fun experience for the participants! To ensure that our Hackers could feel the thrill and excitement of a community-event even in our virtual scenario, Hack2Educate followed a unique phased format. Hackers went through an entire startup lifecycle within the 48-hours duration:  
`Ideate → Understand product-market fit → Build an MVP → Market it → Elevator Pitch with investors`   
  
We had organised several events for the Hackers to have shared experiences virtually. These included:  
<ins>4 mini-events:</ins> MS Paint Bob Ross event, Shell Shockers game night, Snyk Cybersecurity challenge, Skribbl night    
<ins>3 surprise day-long events:</ins> Best workstation event, Build in Public event, Teach in a minute event  
<ins>3 mentoring sessions:</ins> Open source your project through Github, Startups during college, How to network during virtual events  
  
All team submissions were made on **Github**. Every Hacker was provided a video guide for getting started with Github as well as how to easily create beautiful ReadMe markdowns. Github's logo and link was added on our website as well as all our social media posts.  
We had also organised the "best use of GitHub" challenge as provided by MLH and details about this challenge were discussed in the opening ceremony.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 
We encouraged college students from both Engineering and non-engineering domains who had never been part of an MLH Hackathon to participate.  
To encourage participation from women in tech, we had walked the extra mile to excite students to have at least one female member in their teams.  
  
Male registrations: 75.4%, Female and non-binary registrations: 24.6%  
68.1% of registrations were from under-represnetd Tier-II and Tier-III cities in India.  
  
To ensure that our Hackers have a free-flowing discussion in both Hindi and English, we had to reject the applications of the 5% non-Indian nationalities who had registered for Hack2Educate.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Since this was our first-time organising a Hackathon, we hadn't expected receiving MLH membership or securing Github sponsorship.  
So our budget was very tightly knit around the most essential needs of the Hackers.  
Github's grant helped us take the Hacker experience to a whole new level with special prizes dedicated to "Build in Public" and "Open source" ideologies!  
With Github's grant, we were able to:
- Send cool swags to Hackers who won our daily surprise challenges.
- Provide meals to several Hackers who stayed up till very late night working on their Hacks.
- And finally, we ended up spending a little more money than we had planned for. So the grant helped us bridge the difference.  
  
Thank you Github! ❤️
