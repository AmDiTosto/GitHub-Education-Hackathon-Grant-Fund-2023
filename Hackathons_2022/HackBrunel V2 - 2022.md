# HackBrunel V2
 - 19th - 20th November 2022
 - Brunel University London
 - Uxbridge, London, England

## Event Summary
Hack Brunel V2 was a 24-hour event starting from 9am on Saturday 19th November 2022 until 3pm Sunday 20th November 2022. The event was outstandingly successful with participants attending from not only Brunel University London and neighbouring universities such as Royal Holloway, but also from as far as Spain and Boston- Massachusetts. Over the course of the weekend, we had approximately 55 students developing their ideas and projects, as well as taking part in many of our mini events throughout the day. These included a Python workshop hosted by GDSC Brunel, an Astronomy show and late-night movie in the Immersive 360 STEM dome, and a capture the flag cyber-security SNYK challenge hosted by MLH! All teams were given an opportunity at the end of the event to present their hacks/projects in the Howell theatre and compete for a wide range of prizes ranging from 100$ of crypto, YubiKeys, drawing tablets, gaming sets, Amazon Echos and much more.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
Hack Brunel V2 focused on beginning hackers with around 60% of attendees being very new to coding, allowing them to gain the most from our starter workshops such as Introduction to Python hosted by GDSC Brunel. We aimed to provide support where needed, with staff always available to assist all attendees, as well as sourcing any resources that were required for the attendee’s success.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Grant was largely used for catering of the event, which we were struggling to lock in from sponsors. The GitHub grant funding was very helpful as we were able to meet our minimum budget to run our event. This confirmed funding allowed us to house the number of people we expected to come to the event meaning we did not have to limit tickets before the event.
