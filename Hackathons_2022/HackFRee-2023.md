> Provide a description of your event, including but _not_ limited to: <br>

 - **January 14-15, 2023** 
 - **Manalapan High School**
 - **Monmouth County, New Jersey**  

## Event Summary

- HackFRee was a 24 hours of hacking, helping our audience learn new skills, new programming languages and experience team work. Over 200 hackers across our school district (6 high schools) joined us for a variety of mini-events, workshops, and worked collaboratively on their projects. 
Throughout the weekend hackers were encouraged to work on projects that would help them to learn new skills and in many cases experience programming for the first time. There’s a summary of some of our top projects down below. Beyond just hacking though, our team coordinated other activities for hackers too. Our events such as the Engineering Challenge using Design Thinking, origami contest and multiple workshops that were run primarily by our students were a huge success! The mini-events hosted by MLH, Capture the Flag and MS Paint Bob Ross were well received by our attendees. For many of our students Capture the Flag was a great introduction to the field of cybersecurity; MS Paint Bob Ross was a great inspiration to our students as they tried their painting skills using technology. 
 <br>
- GitHub was listed on our website as a sponsor and was mentioned during our opening and closing ceremonies. In addition, our mentors were helping hackers to get started with GitHub and many of our students used it for collaboration.  <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Our team would not have been able to host our event without the help of the GitHub Grant. It was really a great relief when we were struggling for funding, and it ultimately allowed us to support more hackers than we expected. <br> 
- Ultimately, we spent our grant money towards a healthy dinner for our hackers Saturday night.

## Top Projects

We had tons of amazing projects at Power Up Hacks, but we did need to narrow it down and select some top projects to award prizes to. Some of our favorite projects were;
Plant Gizmo
Plant app that will change your life.

Plant Gizmo is a user-friendly application that helps planters obtain all necessary information so that they can get planting as soon and accurately as possible. Plant Gizmo will also notify users when their plant needs to be watered, repotted, or put in sunlight. This app was created using java in android studios.

Living Simulator
Simulate your life and get feedback

You can choose your own adventure game that will show you how your actions can add up. The game has branching paths and hidden values to show how your actions affect you.

Nook to Nest
Nook to Nest: Safe Shelter, no matter the weather.

During the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of homeless people. In times of natural disasters, those people will have no safe and comfortable place to stay, which is why we decided to make Nook To Nest. Our website provides displaced people due to natural disasters with a map, showing the nearby locations of shelters in which they can stay. We also have a chat box, in which displaced people can find someone to talk to about their problems and get assistance.
MAPalapan
All in one connection to popular Manalapan High School products/applications

Seeing the popularity of the school and its extracurricular activities, we wanted to make an easy way for people to represent their home high school with pride. We also saw different ways of communication for different events. We decided to create an app to streamline this communication.
MAPalapan is a project where students can access school resources, such as the school store, the calendar of the school year, etc. The school store allows students to reserve their goods online, so that when they go to school the next day, they will be able to pick it up in the morning. In addition, students will have access to a calendar with important events, such as school cancellations, final exams, AP exams, etc.
Daliant Chrome Extension
Chrome Extension that aids in time management.

Many people have trouble managing their time and limiting themselves to certain websites. 
This google extension is a time management tool to keep the user on task. The user can limit the time spent on each task and the preferences are saved to the user's account, which could be created on our Wix website. Our extension can also display the user's google calendar so that they can have quick access to their important events.

## What’s Next?
HackFRee is a yearly hackathon. Our next event is TBD but will likely take place in January 2024. With the funds from GitHub, we were able to focus on our continued work in our community and will keep growing.
