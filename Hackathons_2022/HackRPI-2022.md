## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - Due to Institute covid policies, we had only intended to target RPI students this year, however, this did not go quite to plan and instead we had a diverse range of student from around the capital region, around the country, and even around the world. 
 - 26.6% of participants identified as women, non-binary, or other
 - 75.1% of participants were part of a gender minority

| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White |
|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|---------:|--------:|
|0|3.8%|4.8%|51.4%|25.1%|

6% Selected "Multiple Ethnicities"
7.2% Selected "prefer not to answer"
The remaining 1.7% selected "other" and then proceeded to misspell ethnicities that were already listed as options
  and as such they have not been listed here

|6.1%|93.5%|0.2% (UK)|0.2% (Brazil)|

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Realistically, you can run a hackathon with $0.00
  - That doesn't mean you should
    - With funding you can do far more and be far more successfull
- HackRPI doesn't allocate specific funding sources to specific expenses
- The fund the github grant went into was used for:
  - Food (to keep hackers full, happy, & healthy)
  - Venue & Janitorial Services (to give us a place to hold the event & keep the school happy)
  - Stickers & Shirts (They aren't just keepsakes, these are critical for promoting the event to future students)

## Top Projects

- Our first place overall project was [Launchmeet.](https://devpost.com/software/launchmeet-0k34ls) ([Github](https://github.com/jolow99/HackRPI))
  - Launchmeet. uses the blockchain to build communities around space launches.
- Our crowd favorite was [FYA](https://devpost.com/software/fya)
  - FYA used reverse engineered APIs to create a CLI tool to order food from resturaunts
- 2 different projects used completely different methods of NLP to create summaries of videos
- One team made a game that is controlled entirely by hand gestures in front of your webcam ([Github](https://github.com/ethanz2003/MLHHackRPI2022))
- One team made a Google Maps like navigation app designed to work on other planets ([Github](https://github.com/anaveo/cosmopilot))
