# HackTX 2022
> HackTX is an annual hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin. A hackathon is simply a space for students of any major to come together and come up with creative solutions using technology. They are a place to learn, to meet others, and to innovate. We design our hackathons to be beginner-friendly and provide plenty of mentors and workshops to guide students! <br>
 - **Oct 15 - 16** 
 - **The University of Texas at Austin / Freetail Hackers**
 - **Austin, Texas, United States**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 

This was the first year since 2019 that the 24 hour hackathon was fully in-person. We had over 52% of our appplications being first-time hackers and beginners. Over 1650 people applied for the hackathon, and admission was competitive in that we only accepted 550. We catered unique Austin delights and provided some of the best food seen in the hackathon space. We provided 9 AM - 11PM workshops on Saturday, including some on the next day - Sunday. We were proud to have a team of 43 organizing members to create a phenomenal experience for everyone involved!

- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>

Some of the cool swag we provided was leather keychains to all attendees and special guiests. We hosted mini-events like a games night, movie time, sunrise event in the morning, midnight gongcha boba and snacks! As another cool feature, we provided deoderants, face cleaning wipes, toothbrushes, and mouth wash to all attendees to promote healthy hygenic practices during the event. We had over 15 workshops that began from the start of the week on Monday and went all the way to Sunday. These explored the topics of game development, blockchain, chrome extensions, robotics, machine learning, entrepreneurship, and so much more! We hope to include computer vision and hardware sometime i the future. Oh we also had a student-made and run day-of app that sent push notoficagtions for any major announcemnts and a QR code unique to each person to keep food and powerstrip inventory! 

- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 

GitHub was featured at the event through many avenues. We had the logo on our main website and day of site. We had the "best use of GitHub" challenge as provided by MLH. We gave out GitHub stickers, swag, and other items before and during the event to promote cross-advertising.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>

We used it to buy emergency food for hackers who had dietary restrictions including gluten free, lactose free, halal, pork, ginger, and tomato allergens. We also used it to buy extra swag bags and swag that we initially fell short off for all attendees. We bought a bat costume to keep the spirit of the hackers high through our org mascot. 

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>

The funds helped to provide special meals to students who had many dietary restrictions and were unaccounted for before. It also helped to boost morale and make sure that everyone who came felt included at the event. It helped to create an emergency fund in case things went wrong, which food was our biggest concern. By being able to provide these new resources, hackers felt nourished and no longer angry to continue to participate in the event.

## What’s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>

HackTX 2022 was the first fully in-person event after 3 years! We got more than 2x the applications that we were expecting, and welcomed so many more first-time hackers and beginner hackers. That also came with its own challenges. We mishandled registration and check-in of 600 people all at once. Our database crashed and many were left standing outside for a while. However our organizing team did really well in recovering from this mishap, and continued to communicate throughout the event. Hackers had some of the best international food offered in Austin, and we had a chance to award upto 14 prizes! Definitely a memorable hackathon and thank you GitHub for their educational fund. 

- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>

Spring Hackathon: April 15. Fall Hackathon: October 2023.
