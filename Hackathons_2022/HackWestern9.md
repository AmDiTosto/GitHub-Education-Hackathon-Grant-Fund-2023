# Hack Western 9
> Provide a description of your event, including but _not_ limited to: <br>
 - Nov. 18-20, 2022
 - Western University
 - London, Ontario, Canada

## Event Summary

- Hack Western 9 returned in an in-person format for the first time since Hack Western 6. <br> 
- We held a variety of fun activities and workshops, including slime making, a fire noodle challenge, karaoke, and a resume roast workshop! For the full schedule of all our events, check out hackwestern.com/live/schedule <br>
- **GitHub** was leveraged in all our hackers' projects in order for them to work collaboratively on their projects. At the end, they also attached their repos to their project submissions on Devpost. We also had a 'Most Creative use of Github' challenge presented by MLH which allowed hackers to be further exposed to Github! <br> 
- We captured so many amazing moments from the event, and we can't wait to share them on our socials including a recap video and yearbook. Stay tuned! @hackwestern. <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The Github Grant was used to support various aspects of our hackathon: from food, to transportation, to activity costs. Thanks to the Github Grant, we were able to have adequate funds to support our hackers during the weekend with quality food and transporting hackers outside of Western.

## Top Projects
- The team who won the Most Creative Use of Github was gitPlace, who made a r/place-inspired project leverage the README files on Github! Check it out here: <br>

## Event Photos

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- As a whole, the organizers are extremely pleased with the results of the event, especially as we hadn't had experience running an in-person hackathon with many alumni graduating during the pandemic years. Hacker and sponsor feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and we can't wait to do it all again next year! <br>
- Hack Western 10 will be taking place in late November 2023. <br>
