 - **Organization: INAXIA**
 - **Location: Online**  

## Event Summary
- What made your hackathon special or unique?
  - At INAXIA, we encourage participants to solve real-world problems through their coding skills. So, we did Community Connects every week to ask our hackers what they're building and helped them improve their products while they were in the process of building it. Not only that, we've invited web3 devs to encourage our hackers to give them exposure to blockchain. Our main goal was to develop skills in them to think about the problems around them and build thir solutions by themselevs <br>
- What were some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br> 
  - The Community Connects were one of the most engaging mini-events we've organized. It was an open discussion where we've discussed about "First year of college life", "How to get hackathon ideas", "How to initiate a startup as student", and many such exciting topics for the hacker's growth. Moreover, we've invited speakers from the leading organizations like Microsoft, Postman, etc. to give talks about to various topics like app/web development, blockchain development, building communities, cracking interview, making good user experience, etc. <br>
-  How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
    - The GitHub platform was utilized to submit projects, test, version control, and collaboration. <br>

## Top Projects
- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br> 
  - One of the coolest projects at the event was presented by our winner for Web2.0 Advanced track: Anserd. It was a doubt-solving platform for the youngsters who are always curious and eager to know more and more but are bounded by the lack of proper access to the resources and platforms. 
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
  - Hackers mainly used GitHub as a version control to collaborate with each other for the project. It was also used to test their projects individually and for the hackathon submission.
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
  - It's special because of it's cool features like it can make a new category for the questions and start asking questions, all the answers are provided by the peers and any number of users can answer any question without any bounds, the answers are ranked based on the votes of the viewers, which in turn rank the writers, and high ranking writers get some extra privileges.
