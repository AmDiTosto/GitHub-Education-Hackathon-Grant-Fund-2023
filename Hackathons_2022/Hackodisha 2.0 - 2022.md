## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
- The funds we from Github were completely used towards improving the Hacker Experience. First, we used the funds to secure the food vendor and the event management vendor that provided us with the much-needed refreshments and green screens, mics, video streamers and stands with a perfect data connection that helped us in reaching our virtual hackers. We also used the fundd to make fun events that were not accessible to us before to keep the hackers engaged throughout. We also increased the prize money which made it more lucrative for all the hackers which in turn increased the number of ingenious projects thus reaching the target of this hackathon.
