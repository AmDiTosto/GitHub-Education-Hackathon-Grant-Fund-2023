# Kent Hack Enough 2022
KHE is a free event open to highschoolers, undergrads, graduate students, and the recently graduated! We aim at beginners and first time hackers, and put a large focus on learning new skills.
KHE was held from October 15th-16th in Kent, OH at the Design Innovation Hub. KHE is run by Kent State's on-campus coding club, HacKSU.

## Event Summary

KHE2022 was a huge success this year! After having been virtual for 2 years, we were excited to return to in-person! Our attendees were very excited to finally be able to attend an in-person Hackathon!
Throughout the event we held workshops geared towards beginners, including a lesson how to debug your code, as well as a lesson on how to use Github and Github Pages.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
Our target audience was beginner programmers and hackers. This correlates well to our attendee metrics, where over half reported KHE as being their first hackathon.
Out of our 53 attendees, 11 reported themselves as Female, 39 Male, 1 Nonbinary, and 2 Prefered Not to Disclose

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
We did not collect race/ethnicity data from our Hackers.


### Where were your hackers from?
We did not collect this information from our Hackers.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant was used to help fund and construct a hardware lab for our Hackers to check out items from to use for their hack. Our lab consisted of mostly Arduinos and MCU parts, which a couple teams used as part of their final hacks. Our hackers reported that the lab was a very nice addition, and we hope to start building it out over the next few years to help expand it and include other types of hardware, such as VR Headsets and Laptops.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
KHE 2022 went amazingly! While our numbers were low compared to what we pulled in the past, we completely expected this after COVID! We are planning to steadily grow KHE back to where it was in 2019!
The next KHE is planned for sometime in October 2023
