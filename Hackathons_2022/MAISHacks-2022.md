# MAIS Hacks 2022
 - **Event date:** October 1-2, 2022
 - **Organized by:** McGill Artificial Intelligence Society
 - **Location:** Montreal, Canada  

## Event Summary

This year, MAIS Hacks promoted inclusivity & innovation in AI in the most awesome way yet: for the first time ever, the hackathon had three unique tracks, each with their own workshops, mentors, and prizes!

**General track:** Your typical hackathon. With machine learning, our hackers created something amazing. The General track featured 2 industry workshops and an introductory ML workshop.

**Beginner track:** Our first-time hackers worked with our instructors to develop their first model. The Beginner track featured a series of mini-workshops to take our hackers through their first ML project!

**Policy track:** For our hackers interested in the non-technical side of AI. Teams worked together to create an ethics policy for a company's AI product rollout. The Policy track featured industry workshops hosted by several AI societies in Montreal!

We encouraged our hackers to collaborate on their projects using GitHub and distributed GitHub cheat sheets to each participant!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
The target audience for our event was, of course, students interested in artificial intelligence! However, with our multi-track event, we hoped to encourage students with less experience to participate. We know that hackathons can be intimidating for newbies, so the beginner track is a smooth transition towards a typical hackathon.

Other than less experienced hackers, we aimed to promote diversity in our hackathon. 33% of our hackers identified as female or non-binary.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?

N/A: information not collected

### Where were your hackers from?

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub funds were used towards prizes for our very best hackers! With the help of the grant, we were able to offer a total of 17 prizes. Having that many prizes in a hackathon is very motivating for students, because it makes them believe they can actually win something.
