## Impact of GitHub Grant

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
  * The hackers were really happy to see the raised prize pool and put in more efforts and hardwork to make some really good outcomes of their skills and knowledge.
  
## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
  * The coolest project was CareLinkUp - Secure and easy access to sensitive patient data. 
    The project ensures that the data is tamper-resistant, as any attempt to alter the data would be easily detectable. 
    Second, it would provide a permanent and auditable record of all transactions involving the data, allowing for greater transparency and accountability. 
    Third, it would allow for the secure sharing of data between different health care providers, as the data would be encrypted and only accessible to those with the appropriate permissions.
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
  * Hackers mainly used GitHub as a version control to collaborate with each other for the project. It was also used to check their projects individually along with the hackathon submission.
  (All the projects have github link along with their project submission on devpost)
  
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
  * Developing projects from scratch within 24hrs is very competitive and a real test of skills. Given the problem statements right at 0th hour and strict submission
  at 24th hour, the participants had a very strict timeline to put team work, individial skills, and presentation skills altogether to bring their projects alive.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
  * It was an amazing hack experiance as organisers for the team. All the members of the oraganising team were themselves students only and 
    had first time experience organising an hackathon. The team made sure all the edges were touched and the regular guidance by MLHers made
    any possible mistakes go. We received an amazing feedback from the participants and most of them were willing to participate in the future 
    hacks as well. The participants as well as the organising team were satisfied with their efforts.
    
- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>
  * TechEden is organised by the Open Source Community: VIT-AP every year in between November to December. Hence, the next Hackathon will occur next year in 2023 during November to December.
