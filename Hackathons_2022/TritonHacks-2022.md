# TritonHacks 2022
 - **May 21-22, 2022** 
 - **Organized at the University of California San Diego**
 - **La Jolla, California**  

## Event Summary

We are a high school hackathon, and nearly all of our participants are first-time hackers. However, in addition to this, we focused our outreach efforts on communities
in Southern San Diego that traditionally are lacking in STEM educational opportunities, where many students have absolutely zero coding experience. 
In order to make them feel welcome at our event despite these barriers, we matched every competing team with a mentor who regularly checked-in on 
their progress. Additionally, we had been curating 6 starter kit projects on topics such as web development, game development, machine learning, and data visualizations 
that are well-documented explaining their respective topics with starter code for students to fill in and extend upon to develop their own unique projects. 
We believe that these had a very important impact on students and helped them complete the event with a sense of achievement and encourage them to pursue further coding.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
 These funds were used to buy food and drinks for hackers. Food is a fundamental part of the experience of coming to our event because we want to make everyone as comfortable as they can be while participating
