## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>

 - **We were able to get more water and food for hackers with dietary restrictions, secure the venue and insurance, and reimburse hackers for parking costs.**

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>

 - **Hackers were more satisfied with food options, we were able to secure venues to accomodate hacker needs, and we made it more accessible for hackers to come to the event by reimbursing parking costs.**

- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.) 

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br> 

 - **One project called "Handstruments" used computer vision to allow users to play instruments such as bongos and a theramin in the air!** [view it here] (https://devpost.com/software/handstruments)
 - **Another great project was Navigrade, which tracks user’s drive score using speed, looking both ways at stops, and attention span. If the user is tired, the app presents a route closest to rest stop.** [view it here] (https://devpost.com/software/navigrade)

- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>

 - **Hackers pushed code to their GitHub repositories throughout the event to better work with their teammates, and showcased code in their repo during demos to judges.**
