# WHACK 2022
 - **Start / End Dates: November 12-13, 2022** 
 - **Organization /  University: WHACK / Wellesley College**
 - **Location: Wellesley, USA**  

## Event Summary
WHACK is Wellesley College’s premier hackathon whose mission is to provide a supportive environment 
for hackers of underrepresented gender and ethnic identities to learn more about tech. This past fall, 
WHACK was the first hackathon for 83% of our participants and over 87% of hackers identified as being female, 
queer, or non-binary. WHACK 2022 was a fun-filled weekend of hacking, engaging workshops such as Intro to Figma, 
GitHub, HTML/CSS, fun mini-events such as Among Us and Snyk Security Challenge, and great food! At WHACK, 
Wellesley’s Google Student Developer’s Club led a popular and successful **GitHub** workshop which allowed many 
hackers to learn the basics of GitHub and start off their hacks using GitHub.

## What’s Next?
- WHACK 2022 was a success! After two years of prior virtual hackathons, WHACK 2022 was a fun and rewarding experience not only for the organizing team 
but also for hackers, mentors, and sponsors. Although it was everyone's first time organizing a hackathon on our organizing team, we received much 
positive feedback on how well WHACK was organized from hackers and mentors, sponsors wanting to come again next year, and how hackers felt so rewarded 
to have learned so much at WHACK in only one weekend. We are so excited that WHACK was a positive experience for our attendees and look forward to 
WHACK 2023, next year in the fall! We can't wait for WHACK to grow in the coming iterations and provide a fun and supportive space for more hackers to 
learn more about tech! You can follow us through our [website](https://www.wellesleyhacks.org) and our social media on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wellesleyhack?lang=en)
