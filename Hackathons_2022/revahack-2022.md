## Event Summary

REVA HACK 2022 was a multi-track Hybrid hackathon held at REVA University from November 11–13. During the 48-hour competition, students offered answers centred on our topic of "A step toward the future." Real-world issues like climate change, sustainable cities, and others are addressed in the problem statements. This year, more than 1,000 people registered, and more than 150 people attended the event physically.
We had conducted "Learnathons" a week prior to the event to teach hackers about various technical topics.
Mini Events were held for both virtual and physical attendees.
Majority of hackers in our event used Github to collaborate with other members. We also required that they have a github repo in order to check for plagiarism and monitor their process.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Due to communication problems on both ends, we were unable to receive the funds during the hackathon, but we did have a prior need for them. Additionally, some expenses during the hackathon were combined at the last minute to improve the participant experience, particularly for those who were present on venue.
Therefore, such costs as well as other post-hackathon expenses are covered by the grant.
