# AthenaHacks 2023
 <br>
 
#### February 25 - 26, 2023
#### University of Southern California / AthenaHacks
#### Los Angeles, CA, USA  

## Event Summary

AthenaHacks was a spectacular 24 hours dedicated to closing the gender gap, exploring new technologies, and building the next big thing. Throughout the weekend, hackers were encouraged to participate in technical workshops, social activities, networking with sponsors, and, of course, hacking!
<br>
 Many of our mini-events were a hit with our hackers this year. We hosted an AMA where hackers could ask our very own AthenaHacks alumni about post-grad life, career, coding interviews, and everything in between. Later at night, our Just Dance event was a huge success and brought up the energy and motivation that everyone needed in order to code throughout the night! And our 10pm boba social was, of course, a fan-favorite.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
AthenaHacks is Southern California’s premier women-centric hackathon (trans and non-binary inclusive).

 Our mission is to support and nurture students of marginalized gender identities in the tech space. We also emphasize being a beginner-friendly hackathon to help close these gender gaps. 100% of our hackers are women and more than half of them are new to coding. We're proud to say that 100% of them are extremely curious and creative! We provide support and resources to our hackers in the form of workshops, mentorship, and a welcoming and inclusive environment.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Grant definitely played a role in the success of our event--with the grant funds, we were able to provide a healthier and more diverse range of lunch and dinner options to accommodate different diets. We also used some of it to purchase hardware for our hackers.

## Top Projects

We were blown away by all of the cool projects our hackers were able to produce in just 24 hours. Here are just a few of our favorites:

- [Warmen](https://devpost.com/software/warmen) - WARmen combines the words “war” and “women” in a bullet-hell style game that battles stereotypes and societal pressures placed on women.
- [Forte](https://devpost.com/software/forte-y8zj35) - A web app that gives YOU the space to talk about your favorite songs with your friends and connect through music!
- [Rowze!](https://devpost.com/software/rowze-ofmrvq) - A morning productivity accountability app where friends or family can compete through random tasks for a collectively decided prize ... or punishment!

## What’s Next?
AthenaHacks is an annual hackathon. Our next event is TBD but will likely take place February or March 2024. We're thankful to have received a GitHub Grant which allowed us to increase the quality of our hackathon for our hackers. Stay tuned on our Instagram at @athena_hacks.
