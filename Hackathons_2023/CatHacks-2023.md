## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
-- The funds were used to cover all the prizes we have decided on for our participants. They also helped us cover the costs of setting up the the physical space and the associated janitorial services.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
-- The funds played a crucial role in bringing the event together. Due to adequeate prizes, we had many hackers who came up with awesome ideas and used the prizes as a motivation. <br>
-- Github funds allowed us the money we raised from other sponsors to be used towawrds getting plenty food, drinks, and snacks so that the the hackers didn't have to worry about that and could focus hacking and having fun!


## Top Projects
Even with a limited sample size, the spectrum of projects was amazing! We had people use Machine Learning, Web Devlopment, Game Development, Hardware hacks, and many more things withing these 24 hours! Here are some of the projects our judges loved (and we loved as well) and announced them as winners:

- [**Cross-Stitch Maker**](https://devpost.com/software/cross-stitch-maker): A mobile app for Android that accepts images from the phone gallery, and allows you to produce a low-fidelity cross-stitch pattern using machine learning. The user is allowed to customize the size of their pattern, and the number of different colors of floss. All colors in the pattern map directly to real colors you can purchase at craft stores like Michaels!

- [**WarPaint Robots**](https://devpost.com/software/totally-not-fireboy-and-watergirl): Local multiplayer game where two players run around platforms racing to get coins with a portal twist. <br> 

- [**Melody Map**](https://devpost.com/software/melody-map-24wtxn): Oftentimes at music festivals there can be an overwhelming amount of artists, times, and locations. Our goal is to simplify this experience by taking user data to recommend a music festival map. !

- [**Youniverse**](https://devpost.com/software/youniverse-frst6m): This website provides a daily 'challenge' to encourage users to complete at least one mental health activity each day.

To keep the projects limited, we will not mention all the projects. But we strongly beleive that this all the project submissions this year were creative, innovative, and amazing to learn about.

All the listed projects above used Github to host and share their projects! All the listed projects above were built by teams, and we were happy to see teams collabrate on projects using Github. <br>
