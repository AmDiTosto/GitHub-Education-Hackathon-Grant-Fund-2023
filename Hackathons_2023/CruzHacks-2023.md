# CruzHacks 2023

**Date:** February 3-5, 2023 <br>
**Organized by:** Santa Cruz Hack, Inc. (CruzHacks) <br>
**Hosted at:** University of California, Santa Cruz <br>
**Located at:** Santa Cruz, California, USA

## Event Summary

CruzHacks is the largest hackathon in Santa Cruz, CA. Each year, we invite hundreds of students to develop solutions to real-world problems, pursue inclusion in tech, and kindle the spirit of innovation. Since our inaugural event in 2013, CruzHacks has become one of the largest student tech events on the Central Coast of California. 

CruzHacks 2023's main prize tracks revolved around innovation for social good, with themes including social justice, sustainability, financial accessibility, and healthcare. The secondary prize categories challenged hackers to push beyond their limits, with rewards for first-time hackers, those that utilized new technologies (AI, VR, blockchain, etc.), projects with amazing UI/UX, and projects that benefitted our college community.

CruzHacks 2023 hackers got to hear from inspirational speakers such as the Senior Director of Engineering at Apple, the Chief Product Officer for Microsoft Dynamics 365, and the Chief Aerodynamicist at Joby Aviation. Hackers also had the opportunity to attend a mix of technical and non-technical workshops, as well as fun activities such as MS Paint Bob Ross, throughout the event. Cool technologies, such as Niantic's Lightship AR technology, were made available for hackers to use in their project as well.

GitHub was absolutely critical to our event's success. The funds helped us ensure hackers were well-fed, and most of our hackers used GitHub for their projects as a part of their workflow.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

CruzHacks 2023's primary audience was undergraduate students of any major that were currently enrolled in a university. However, we did accept younger students, as long as they were enrolled in a secondary school or higher. We also accepted Masters and Ph.D. level students, as well as students from alternative schools such as bootcamps.

Increasing diversity in the tech industry is one of the core goals of CruzHacks as an organization. We strive to perform outreach to underrepresented groups and make our event as beginner-friendly as possible. 

As a result of our efforts, here are the diversity statistics for CruzHacks 2023:
 
#### Gender:
 |Male|Female|Nonbinary|Declined to State|
 |---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|
 |64.4%|28%|2.3%|5.3%|
 
#### Sexuality:
 |Heterosexual|LGBTQIA+|Declined to State|
 |---------------:|---------------:|---------------:|
 |69.87%|16.53%|13.6%|

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White |
|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|---------:|--------:|
|3 Hackers|4 Hackers|45 Hackers|244 Hackers|75 Hackers|

Notes: 
- The sum is not equal to the number of hackers since some hackers identify with multiple ethnicities, and some hackers declined to state their ethnicities.
- For the purposes of these groupings, "Asian" includes East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.


### Where were your hackers from?
| Asia Pacific | North America | Europe / UK | Other |

## Impact of GitHub Grant

We used the GitHub Grant funds to help purchase food for hackers. The funds helped us make sure that we could keep our participants well-fed throughout the whole event, so that they could focus more on hacking and less on things like finding food. 

As an event returning to an in-person format after 2 years of holding our event as a virtual event, these funds were critical to the event's success.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

CruzHacks 2023 marked our return to being an in-person event after 2 years of holding our event virtually. We believe the event was a success, with higher levels of participation, more diversity, and an amazing project submission rate when compared to previous years. 

As an annual event, CruzHacks will be back next year for CruzHacks 2024! While the day is still to be determined, we anticipate holding the event in-person sometime between January and March, 2024.
