## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Thanks to the GitHub Fund, we were able to provide food and snacks for everyone who came to our event. We also kept up the tradition of giving out boba tea to everyone on the first night.The snacks and boba tea made people happy and let them focus on having fun and learning instead of being hungry. This made the event better for everyone. <br>
- Without the help from GitHub, our event might not have been as successful. Having good food and keeping our boba tea tradition alive made the event special and helped bring people together. This kind of support really makes a difference and helps us keep doing what we do. 

## Top Projects

- [**Turing Problem**](https://devpost.com/software/turing-trouble): It teaches rudimentary Turing Machine concepts, via 10 multi-tape-based puzzles. The user chooses how the functions look and then presses RUN, testing if their transition table solves the level. <br> 
- [**Quiz Voyage**](https://devpost.com/software/quiz-voyage): Our project is designed to revolutionize the process of exam preparation by creating an engaging and interactive learning environment. Students can upload their class notes and lecture materials, which are then transformed into a captivating gaming experience. <br>
- [**Streak**](https://devpost.com/software/streak-21pjtk): Streak is a chrome extension that aids in student productivity by displaying a combo meter that gradually increases so long as the student remains on a chrome tab relevant to their desired study subject.
