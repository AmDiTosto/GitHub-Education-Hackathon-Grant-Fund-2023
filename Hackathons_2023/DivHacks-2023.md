# DivHacks
 - **September 23, 2023 - September 24, 2023** 
 - **Columbia University / Women in Computer Science**
 - **NYC, NY, USA**  

## Event Summary

DivHacks's goal is to encourage diversity of backgrounds, ethnicities, and genders, leading to an innovative,
welcoming environment for all of its participants. We hosted a number of workshops with topics ranging from
natural language processing to generative AI. We encourage community development through fun events like a 
spicy ramen challenge, spa night, and a Turing Test challenge, where hackers can truly connect with one another.

## Event Metrics 
We had the greatest amount of interest ever this year, with 700+ applications.
About 50% of participants came from Columbia and Barnard, 
while the other half came from NYU, Stony Brook, CUNY, and more.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the grant funds to pay for our venue. Without the funds, we would not be able to hold the event, as the venue is necessary.
