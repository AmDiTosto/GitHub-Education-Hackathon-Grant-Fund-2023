## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
**Diversion 2k23** was the first in-person MLH hackathon conducted in Kolkata. Our event was a brand new experience for people residing in Kolkata because we do not have many hackathons around here. It was also special as we had over 10 judges/mentors with whom hackers could connect and take their guidance. We also had 17+ communities as our community partners who helped us reach our target audience and helped us in organizing the hackathon and also provided us with valuable feedback.<br>
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
It was a 36-hour long event so participants were bound to get exhausted but we kept them engaged with our fun and exciting mini events, workshops and social media challenges.
<br>Mini-events : Musical chair, Dumb Charades, Open Mic <br>
Workshops : Zeeve Workshop, DigitalOcean Session, 5ire Workshop, Synk cybersecurity challenge<br>
For the social media challenge, we had a live twitter display on our website(www.diversion.tech/live) where hackers could upload pictures of their swags and could win special edition stickers. Some tracks also had their own social media challenges where hackers could win special goodies and t-shirts.<br>

- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
Out of 86 projects submitted, 76 of them participated in the GitHub track. GitHub special edition stickers were given out to the participants. We had also organized the "best use of GitHub" track as provided by MLH and details about this challenge were discussed on the discord channel.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Hacker Demographics
As this was the first time our college organized a hackathon, much less an MLH Hackathon, we focussed on the first-timers and how their first hackathon experience was going to be. We aimed at serving the beginners by providing them with a comfortable and welcoming environment so that they could learn and practice the skills needed for hacking. The approx percentage of males was 77.25%, females was 22.75% and 0% for non-binary and others. We also had special swags for teams with all female members.

### Where were your hackers from?
We had hackers from 24 different universities and schools all over India.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
First and foremost, we would like to thank GitHub Education Hackathon Grant Fund for accepting our application. With such a tight budget, GitHub grant helped us to arrange proper accommodation facilities like bedding, pillow and blanket for the hackers. We could also provide them with better food, thanks to the grant. This grant also helped in improving hacker experience as the prize money could be increased which lured in more participants. <br>

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
Firstly, the hackers weren't empty stomach anytime - due to this grant we could provide them with good meals. Secondly, A portion of the funding was also used to create T-shirts and to print stickers. These merchandises and swags not only helped advertise GitHub and other sponsors but also gave our participants an active reminder of their experiences as being a part of an MLH member event.

- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
GitHub was used to collaborate amongst the team members and used to host websites, using github pages. It was also handy to form organizations and host different repositories of one codebase. Participants also utilized GitHub for version control of the codebase.

- What made them special?<br>
We feel that all the projects were somewhere special because of the ground breaking innovation used. Every project was unique in its own way where all the hackers got to learn something or the other in these 36 hours. They were also special as they implemented cutting edge technology to solve real world problems which put an impact in the society. One more feature to be mentioned would be that all the projects were highly complex architectural applications/websites which were built within 36 hours. This fact itself makes all the projects notewothy.

All the projects are in the devfolio link mentioned above.
