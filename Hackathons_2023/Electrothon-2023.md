## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>

  - Being the first MLH member hackathon of Himachal Pradesh, Electrothon ushered in a new era of hackathons, collaborative building, networking and unconferences in a region that is not conventionally known for the same.

  - Electrothon lived up to its spirit of diversity and inclusion, not just in terms of participation but in terms of the guest lectures held, the mentors invited and the panel of judges involved in the evaluation. A hackathon can definitely be vouched for to be inclusive when there are architecture students coming in to attend guest lectures.

  - Introduction of a hardware hacking contest parallel to the main hackathon garnered great interest from the attendees. Other mini-events catering to various domains were also very well received by the attendees.

  - There was a keenness in attendees to go beyond just building a project by engaging with other hackers to receive feedback, discuss potential technology breakthroughs and support one another through the journey. This was evident by the commendations showered on the winning teams by fellow participants during the prize distribution ceremony. The participants deferred from considering the hackathon as just a contest and rather appraised it as a collaboration.

The mini challenges included:


    **GitHub Glory**: A contest where the participants had to leverage their markdown skills to create a stunning GitHub profile page.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>

    The grant funds were mainly used for the purchase of basic hardware components for _Hardware Hacking_ track introduced parallelly to the hackathon. A small fraction of the grant was also used for the purchase of hacker guides and starter kits.

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>

    The funds had an enormously positive outcome in driving our event towards being a distinctive one. The ‘Hardware Hacking’ track was widely appreciated by the attendees. Considering the time span allocated to hackers for building their hardware hacks, they came up with pretty amazing projects. While a common notion among individuals is that hackathons are for software developers, the purchase of hardware components for this track through the grant funds led to this notion and perspective being broadened.

## Top Projects

Here are a few top projects built at the hackathon along with their links:
