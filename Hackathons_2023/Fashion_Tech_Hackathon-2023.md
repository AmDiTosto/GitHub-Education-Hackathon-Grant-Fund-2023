# Fashion Tech Hackathon 2023
 - **March 17-19th, 2023** 
 - **Kent State University School of Fashion /  TechStyleLAB**
 - **Kent, Ohio, USA**  

## Event Summary

The Fashion Tech Hackathon is a FREE dynamic, collaborative and interdisciplinary event allowing teams of university students to learn new skills and create innovative technology that will help define the future of fashion.

Participating students spend 36 hours developing a project of their choice in the form of a project exploring the intersection of fashion and technology: it could be a technology-enhanced garment, wearable-responsive web application, or disrupting fashion via retail data innovations.

Our hackathon is fashion technology focused. Due to this, a good portion of our students identify as female. We also have a large group of LGBTQ+ students engaged. One of our award challenges was based on designing for Queer musuem spaces.
