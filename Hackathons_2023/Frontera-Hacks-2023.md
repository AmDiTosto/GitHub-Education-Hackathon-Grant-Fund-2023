## Event Summary

- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? We encouraged the use of GitHub so our participants could have their codes stored somewhere reliable so they can work on their projects in the future, and for our judges to be able to access their repositories during the judging period. Safari Hunt won the "Most creative use of GitHub" category. <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? We used it for food catering for our attendees and the purchase of the winners prizes<br>
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? It made sure everyone had a full stomach throughout the event, and had a lot of people who did not participate on the competition to look forward to the next hackathon to participate and even encourage some of their friends to go to other MLH Hackathons around the state. <br>
- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.)

## What’s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
Frontera Hacks brought together teams of future developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on creating innovative tech solutions to solve real-world problems in the Rio Grande Valley. We had over 40 participants, divided into 7 teams, each working on different projects, with most of them experiencing their first hackathon ever.
The hackathon was a success, with all the teams presenting unique and creative ideas at the end of the event. The judges were impressed with the quality of the projects and had a tough time choosing the winners. Ultimately, the team that developed Safari Hunt, a game to help kids with learning disabilities train their critical thinking skills won the "Best Overall Project."
The hackathon provided a platform for innovation and collaboration. It helped foster a community of tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. Some even mentioned how thankful they were to socialize after experiencing 2 years of pandemic and look forward to more events of this kind. Overall, the hackathon was a great success and achieved its goal of promoting innovation and collaboration in the Rio Grande Valley.
