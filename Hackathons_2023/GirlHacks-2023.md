## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - The target audience for our event was women, NJIT students, as well as students from the tri-state area. <br> 

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Thanks to the Github grant, we are able to cover costs, as the scale of our hackathon increases. This helped us cater to different diets, as we are able to accomodate more healthier and more diverse range of lunch and dinner options,
  along with beverages and snacks to help fuel our attendees. We also gave a prize for the most on theme hack.
