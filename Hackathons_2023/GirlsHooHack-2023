## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the grant funds to supply food and hacker needs during our event. Everything from food, snacks, drinks, and other personal items that hackers need in order to be successful! <br>
- The grant impacted our hackers by allowing our hackers not to worry about food, drinks or snacks so that they could focus on their learning!  <br>


## Top Projects

- We had a total of 14 projects, each one of them unique in their own way. Our hackers collaborated mostly in teams and we also had an expo for hackers to present their projects! <br> 
  - How you Brewin: a Chrome extension that offers the ability to select their daily 
  mood from a range of boba-themed emotions. It provides a platform for users to maintain 
  a daily journal, enabling them to express their thoughts and experiences. Additionally, 
  the extension generates a mood calendar to visually represent their emotional journey, 
  making it easier to recognize patterns in their well-being over time. <br>

  - Girl Power: In this game, players step into the shoes of a young girl who faces various
    bullying scenarios. Through engaging gameplay, players learn to respond to sexism and 
    adversity in a positive and constructive manner. "Girl Power!" not only entertains, 
    but also educates and inspires young girls, offering them the guidance and role models needed 
    to navigate real-world complexities with strength, resilience, and grace.

  - Free2Pee: Free2Pee was born from a desire to promote and enable inclusivity and convenience 
    at UVA to empower all individuals, including women, nonbinary people, parents, and those in
    need of accessible restrooms. Inspired by the prevalence and success of Google Maps, which 
    allows users to navigate academic buildings and beyond, we aimed to create a tool that focuses 
    on the unique needs of various users. By providing information about safe, well-maintained 
    restrooms, inclusive facilities, and promoting hygiene and security, we aim to help everyone 
    confidently explore public spaces, ensuring they have access to clean and safe restroom facilities. 
    We believe that informed choices and inclusivity are key to fostering empowerment for all, while 
    making everyday life more convenient.
