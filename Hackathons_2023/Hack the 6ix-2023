## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

Following the pandemic, this was our first in-person pandemic in a while and transitioning away from virtual settings was a challenge. Because Hack the 6ix is not affiliated with one university as a club, we were able to involve multiple universities and have their presence to help students be exposed to what's around them. This time, we were able to involve TMU as the venue sponsor, TMU Blockchain as a workshop speaker, and UofT Rotman as a bronze tier sponsor. Waterloo Blockchain was also scheduled to host a workshop, but unforeseen circumstances made it unable to happen this year unfortunately. Some cool events that we had included "How I sold a startup at 20 years old" workshop, in real life among us event, chubby bunny challenge, and even a Valorant game tournament for hackers interested in gaming. Github was featured as a prize stream and mentioned in both opening and closing ceremony. We encouraged hackers to find creative ways to use github when hacking their project.
