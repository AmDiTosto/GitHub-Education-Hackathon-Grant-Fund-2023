## Top Projects

### 1st Position-
https://devfolio.co/projects/decentralid-a6db
There are many websites and services out there which require us to submit our official documents online to them for purposes such as ID Verification, Age Verification and so on.

Just to prove their identity, users are forced to give away their personal documents which contain a lot more personal data than the user may want to share. Also, there are great chances of the user data being compromised due to data breaches and data theft. This leads to problems of privacy, security, and trust.

This project aim to build a decentralized identity verification service that addresses that addresses these issues. It does so by eliminating the need of uploading documents onto these third-party websites and providing users with full control over the data that they want to share. Our system should allow users to verify their identity, while preserving their privacy and security.The documents of the user are shared only to the issuing authority for verification (which already has it) and no one else. Third party apps can use our API service to verify the user and also it saves them work because we do the verification for them. So multiple goals are achieved through our project.

### 2nd Position-

To provide data about tree cover in an area. One of the most challenging problems India and other G20 countries are facing is the lack of availability of enough data for analysis and prediction. Data helps predict climate change patterns in R&D. This tool can collect tree data from satellite imagery using a deep learning model to find out the tree cover in a particular area. It has wide applications like monitoring the deforestation rate, urban planning, etc.A android app was also developed which can classify your surrounding into 3 regions based on the above DL model.

### 3rd Position-
https://devfolio.co/projects/resqmate-3699
It is a Disaster Risk Management System for better management and collaboration during a natural or man-made disaster. The web helps in the prediction of upcoming natural threats using Nasa API along with using Bert encoding with LSTM for the classification of tweets based on their content (Casualties /Losses / Advice / Donations). Along with that, we have integrated NGOs, Police, and local helpers on our platform for faster evacuation and relief work.

It also provides them the recent stats of the current disaster ongoing Injured, Deaths, and Evacuated. As in the disaster finding the hotspots is difficult so, it also help authorities to identify the hotspots and the type of help needed there with the accurate position on Google Maps, so that help can be provided to them as soon as possible.

Crisis Tweets using Bert
FAQ bot to answer all disaster-related queries
Community bulletin to release alerts, info about evacuation, camps, food, with Live location, relief - facilities, Send alert/important announcements, critical info through messages
Live chat to solve queries for that person who clicks on the help
Immediate/Urgent one-click help through location sharing
Transparency with stats (deaths, evacuated, injured)
Nasa World-wide diaster predictor.
