# HackDearborn
 - March 11th - 12th, 2023
 - University of Michigan - Dearborn
 - Dearborn, MI, USA

## Event Summary

- This was the first large hackathon at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. We brought a hackathon to a community that had never experienced something like this before.
- We had really cool workshops (Flutter, Firebase, Bigquery and Dialogflow) from speakers that we brought in from Google Developer Groups.
- One of the coolest activites we had was a swing dance workshop. This was an activity that almost nobody had tried before and based on the feedback everyone loved it.
- We held an "Intro to Github" workshop leading up to the event. We also featured GitHub during the opening ceremony and thanked them for the support they offered us. We also made it mandatory to host all code on GitHub when submitting the projects.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - We had **30% women attendees**. We were really happy with this number and hope to improve upon it if possible.
 - Our campus has never had a large-scale hackathon like this before. Our campus has a large minority population so it was great to bring something like this to this demographic.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White | Middle Eastern

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The first-ever HackDearborn could not have been a success without the GitHub Grant. We used the GitHub grant primarily for food. 
- Being in a heavily populated middle-eastern setting, we decided to serve mediterranean food as our first meal. This was an expensive meal to serve so the grant helped cover part of the expenese. We felt it was important to recognize the community we were serving during the hackathon.
- Our hackers mentioned in the feedback form that they enjoyed all the meals offered as well as the variety that was served. Hacking is a very mentally draining activity and because of the GitHub grant, we were able to serve delicious food that helped hackers persevere and finish their amazing projects.
- We also invested in some decorations that elevate the ambiance of the venue which will be reused for all future events.

## Top Projects

- We had two categories: general and beginner. We want to highlight the winners of both categories.
- [Bluf](https://devpost.com/software/bluf-youtube) - this team allows you to paste in any YouTube url, then their program will scrub through the video, give you all the important video moments with timestamps, and will also sumamrize the video using AI. A great way to save time and to get to the point!
- [Teddy Tech](https://devpost.com/software/teddy-technologies) - this was one of the projects we were most proud of ourselves. This was a totally beginner team based of all freshmen-girls. Usually, we expect beginner teams to create a simple website using HTML and CSS. This team learned from the dialogflow workshop we had and created a voice-calling chatbot using Google Cloud. That was really cool to see!
