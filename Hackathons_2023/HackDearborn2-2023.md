 - Oct 21 to Oct 22
 - University of Michigan - Dearborn
 - Dearborn, MI

## Event Summary

- We had a software fair where we had cool tech from our sponsors and things we brought in that students could try (VR, AR, autonomous vehicles and rovers, 3D printer, etc)
- We had several GitHub workshops leading up to the event. Everyone was required to commit their code on GitHub to qualify. We also had logos on all of our swag.

All the hackers were from North America

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The GitHub grant helped us a lot in paying for snacks and food to keep students entertained. 
- The grant allowed us to worry less about fund-raising and use more time attracting hackers and working on programming to keep hackers engaged and stay till the end.
- It also allowed us to keep a small emergency budget for any incidental things that might come up.

## Top Projects

- There was one project that was a history simulator in VR. You could interact with historical figures in WW1 trenches and they would talk to you, generated by AI.
- There was another cool project that could detect stress and mental health issues based on some sensor readings (hardware hack).
- Many hackers used GitHub to collaborate with the rest of their team. Some teams made breaking changes but thankfully since they were using GitHub, they were able to revert to earlier, working code.
- There were several teams new to GitHub and it was special to see that they had already mastered the basics of GitHub in the span of a few hours.
