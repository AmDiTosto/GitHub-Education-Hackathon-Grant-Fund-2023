# HackDuke (Code for Good) 2023
 - September 8-10, 2023 
 - Duke University/HackDuke
 - Durham, NC, USA

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
  We really enjoyed having a theme for social good. This year, we featured hacks across the Finance, Environment, Patient Safety, and Education tracks. In addition, we moved to a new, larger venue that allowed all the hackers to be in one space.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
We hosted our annual ramen challenge at night! This is always an exciting feature for HackDuke. This year, we also brought in industry leaders to talk about VC, entrepreneurship, and the startup journey.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
Our event featured a GitHub Copilot workshop from Microsoft. Of course, GitHub was heavily used by all participants and was the primary way we evaluated code from participants.
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
We used our funds to purchase food for participants, especially on our Costco run. This allowed us to get healthy snacks and fruit for hackers.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
It kept our hackers fueled and ready! Fundraising was challenging our team this year and the grant from GitHub played a large part in helping us bolster our food budget, especially on healthier items. Thank you for this!
