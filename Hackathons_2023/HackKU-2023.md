# HackKU 2023
 - **Date:** April 14-16th, 2023
 - **Organized by:** University of Kansas
 - **Located at:** Lawrence, Kansas, USA 

## Event Summary

HackKU is located in a small town in Midwest, and we broke the record this year in attendance. We had over 350 hackers and 70+ projects, more than the double participation that we had last year. HackKU has quickly become the biggest student organized hackathon in the surrounding area. 
HackKU 2023 had two tracks: one general track and one surprise track that was revealed during opening ceremony, revolved around the topic of Accessibility. These two tracks enabled hackers to innovate on projects that interested them, but still gave them the option to choose a narrower track if they wished to do so. We also had Best Beginner Project to encourage beginner hackers to still work on their projects and compete. Something unique that we added this year is the "Hacker's Choice Award" where hackers voted on other hacker's projects by liking them on Devpost. Our sponsors also had great challenges such as "Best Open Source Contribution", "Harness the power of XRPL to create a better world" and more.
Our signature event Midnight Karaoke gathered a lot of attention, along with other fun mini-events like Slideshow Karaoke and MSPaint with Bob Ross, partnered with MLH. We also had a few technical workshops throughout the event like Introduction To Docker, XRPL, Robotic Processing Automation and more.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

HackKU's target audience is undergraduate and graduate students, but we had hackers from non-traditional backgrounds as well. As long as they met our age requirement, HackKU was open to anyone interested. We had a lot of hackers who were not studying Computer Science or related fields. Increasing diversity in the tech industry is one of the core goals of CruzHacks as an organization. We strive to perform outreach to underrepresented groups and make our event as beginner-friendly as possible. 

Here are the diversity statistics for HackKU 2023:
Female attendees: 90
Other/Prefer Not to Answer: 16

## Impact of GitHub Grant

GitHub Grant helped us a lot to make sure we accomadote the needs of everyone at our hackathon and make our event more inclusive. As HackKU was on April 14th-16th, some of our hackers were fasting for Ramadan and needed meal accommodations at appropriate times to break their fast. To make sure that they had an enjoyable experience as well, we used the GitHub Grant to order special food for them for Iftaar and Suhoor. 

## Top Projects

HackKU had a lot of cool projects that revolved around Accessibility theme and other tracks as well. Almost all the teams used Github to collaborate with each other, and some used the GitHub Education Pack to access software that helped them develop their project. A few of the cool projects that we had:
