## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
HackNC is a hackathon event designed to be beginner-friendly and inclusive for minorities. The organizers offer tailored workshops and mentoring sessions to help beginners learn coding basics. Additionally, the event provides targeted resources and mentorship programs to support minorities in the tech industry, creating an empowering environment for diverse individuals to explore coding and technology.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Grant definitely played a role in the success of our event--with the grant funds, we were able to provide a healthier and more diverse range of lunch and dinner options to accommodate different diets. We also used some of it to purchase swag to incentivize our hackers to engage with our workshops, sponsors, and speakers.

## Top Projects

We were blown away by all of the cool projects our hackers were able to produce in just 24 hours. Here are just a few of our favorites:

- [Link](https://devpost.com/software/link-7r0owl) - "Link" is an iOS app designed to help you find people in challenging environments. It utilizes the power of Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip technology to accurately track the direction and distance of other app users.
- [Road Guardian](https://devpost.com/software/road-guardian-0ncg9v) - Our application streamlines the process of reporting road issues. With a single tap, users can snap a photo of a pothole or damaged road, and the app automatically logs its location.
- [foodBuddy](https://devpost.com/software/foodbuddy-pmx60h) - Manage your ingredients, get personalized recommendations for food and exchange your extra ingredients and experiences with your dorm-mates!
