### How was GitHub featured at your event?
HackNJIT 2023 had fully utilized GitHub as a part of the submission guidelines. Hackers were required to finalize all their commits with their submissions on Devpost. The goal is to make sure the projects' completions were in the allotted time and that the code generated during the event was original and made within the given time.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Thanks to the GitHub Grant, the hackathon was able to handle a larger group of people by providing larger servings of food. Due to the influx of numbers this year, exceeding original expectations, the increased food options and the amount had played a major role in making sure the hackers were fed. The grant funds were also used to give more ambiance to the room through decoration. HackNJIT used the budget to purchase small wave light projectors, inflatable beach-themed decorations, and prints of drawings of sea creatures and ships. According to hackers, the added decorations were one of the favorite parts of the hackathon!
