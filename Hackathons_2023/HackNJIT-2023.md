## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The grant funds were used to give more ambiance in the room through decoration. We had planned to use just small LED projection wave lights, but the added funds let us purchase more ambitious decorations
- We purchased a large spotlight, inflatable beach-themed decorations, and prints of drawings of sea creatures and ships
- We hoped that the added ambiance would empower the hackers and their projects

GitHub was used for all submissions to track the progress and ligitimacy of the winners. Despite having another category for best theme, HackNJIT consistently has multiple submissions that always go above and beyond for the top three prizes that still stay consistent with the theme.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- HackNJIT 2023 was a resounding success! Our attendance exceeded that of any past consisting of only college students. Since the devastating effects of COVID-19 on the attendance of in-person hackathons, the progress we have made is incredible. Thank you to the NJIT Ying Wu College of Computing for their support in the months leading to the event, and thank you to our sponsors for making everything happen!
- Next hackathon date is most likely November 3-4, 2024.
