## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the grant funds to provide prizes, free food, and swag to our hackers. <br>
- Without these funds, we would not be able to uphold the morale for our hackers through the swag, meals, and snacks that we provided throughout the whole event. With companies preparing for a tech recession, it was very difficult for us to receive sponsorship for the event. This grant provided us some relief with our funds, allowing us to focus more of our time on the logistics/schedule for our hackers. <br>
