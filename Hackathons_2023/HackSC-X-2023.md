## Event Summary

Our Hacker Experience team organized useful workshops and fun activities. There is an AI toolkit workshop to give beginners some pointers to resources; 
PRHI hosted an introductory workshop for patient safety to guide the participants who were interested in their sponsored challenge; 
and relaxing activities like Just Dance, Karaoke Night, and Morning Yoga reminded the participants to take a break from their intensive coding.

## Impact of GitHub Grant! Thank you so much!

The Github Grant was used to support our food expenses for our hackers, they really enjoyed the nutritious and diverse food they had during HackSC-X, thanks to GitHub!
Providing food for hackers is a very important aspect of hackathons because we would want to lower the barrier of entry for hackers as much as possible so they can 
hack away without worrying about food and other basic needs. We want to provide a comfortable environment for the hackers, and the GitHub grant really helped us in achieving that.
