# HackSussex GameJam 2023
The first annual HackSussex GameJam saw students from all over the UK come together to build exciting and impressive games within a 24 hour window! The event took place between the 25th and 26th November 2023 at the University of Sussex in Brighton. 

## Event Summary
As part of the event, Roto VR launched it's new product, a chair that can spin 360 degrees in order to add a new level of immersion to VR games. Everyone got to play with this new and exciting piece of equiptment and some had a lot of fun developing games specifically with the Roto VR Chair in mind.
Some of the mini-events that were most enjoyed were the Bob Ross MS Paint challenge put on by MLH, as well as the Git for Games talk by our very own Adnan & Val.
