- The workshops we had was an HPC workshop, a workshop on interactive graphics using a canva browser, and a snyk cybersecurity event.

### What's Next
- We really appreciate everyone who helped us at the hackathon. We had 28 submissions and last year we had 19. This github grant is a big part to why we were able to run such a bigger event as the economy was not doing well this year so sponsors were not plenty. The future hackathon, HackTCNJ 2024 is going to run next spring and will already have 1 sponsor. We are on instagram @hacktcnj
