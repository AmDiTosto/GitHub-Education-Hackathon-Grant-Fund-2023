## Github Grant Summary HackTCNJ

### Event Summary
- Our event was unique because of our TCNJ. It was a good blend of TCNJ students, students from other local universities, and high schoolers. Everyone who went to the hackathon got to meet other people.
- The workshops we had was an HPC workshop, a workshop on interactive graphics using a canva browser, and a snyk cybersecurity event. 
- Github was featured at my event because it was required for submission and there was a prize cateogory of Most Creative Use of GitHub sponsored by MLH. The winner of this prize used GitHub for a literary review as well.  
### Event Metrics

### What's Next
- We really appreciate everyone who helped us at the hackathon. We had 28 submissions and last year we had 19. This GitHub Education Grant is a big part to why we were able to run such a bigger event as the economy was not doing well this year so sponsors were not plenty. The future hackathon, HackTCNJ 2024 is going to run next spring and will already have 1 sponsor. We are on instagram @hacktcnj
