## Event Summary

- HackTX is an annual hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin occurring on October 21st-22nd, 2023. A hackathon is simply a space for students of any major to come together and come up with creative solutions using technology. They are a place to learn, to meet others, and to innovate. We design our hackathons to be beginner-friendly and will have plenty of mentors and workshops to guide you!

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Specifically, we were able to buy food for hackers with dietary restrictions. We used the fund to accommodate dietary restrictions as well as hygienic needs of our attendees. We bought pads, tampons, deodorants, toothbrushes, mouthwash, and face wipes. These efforts make our event more inclusive and welcoming for all attendees.
