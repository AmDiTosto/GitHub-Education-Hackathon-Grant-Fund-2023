# Hack the Valley
 - **October 13-15, 2023** 
 - **Hack the Valley**
 - **Canada, Ontario, Toronto**  

## Event Summary

This year, Hack the Valley really focused on beginner hackers and inclusion of non-male hackers. Around 70% of our hackers were high-school students or first-year students and because of that, we had many projects with unique perspectives. Every hackathon we host, we run a Women in Science Summit. The purpose of the Women in Science Summit is to promote a supportive and inclusive environment that helps non-male identifying participants in tech and science achieve their full potential and become future models in the tech industry. They are able to speak to industry leaders to discuss hardships and obstacles and to grow a community. <br>

Some workshops and events we hosted included:
- Blockchain Workshop hosted by ICP
- Hike the Valley (hiking at the UTSC valley)
- Introduction to GenAI
- Therapy Dogs
- In Defense of Quitting
- Women in Science Summit
- PM in AI
- Resume Roast and Tips
- Magician Mix and Mingle
- Securing your Dream Internship

Hackers used Github to commmit code to their projects and was featured as a prize category provided by MLH. We also used Github in our development team for our website!

## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used the Github Grant funds to cover a lot of the expenses for our Women in Science Summit, such as travel for our speakers, food, swag, and activities. Refreshments were provided in order to bring participants to the summit and prizes were given out for our networking activity, which helped our participants get to know one another. For our Women in Science Summit, our event was able to focus on inclusion for non-male hackers in the tech space. Hackers were able to meet leaders in the industry and network with other hackers in the space. They created mentor groups within the summit and created a supportive environment at Hack the Valley. The Github Grant helped us run another successful Women in Science Summit, which we may not have been able to do due to rising expenses.
