We use your camera to scan your mail and recognize names. This then causes the ESP8266 to turn on its designated LED <br>

Users are given a caterpillar that they can name. They take care of the caterpillar by performing tasks -- primarily through logging their medication intake. When the user logs their medication, the caterpillar gets fed and gains "Berry Points." After a certain amount of points are earned, the caterpillar will turn into a cocoon. After earning even more points, the cocoon hatches into a butterfly that can be added to the users "Butterfly Garden." When the garden reaches a capacity of 10 butterflies, the butterflies can be released. The user can also log their symptoms and pain scale every day, which is logged in a calendar view to show progress over time. <br>

The goal of the program is to simplify and automate the investing experience. Using an algorithm based on several factors, the user can easily get both the current score of a specific stock and the predicted score of the stock. The user can easily set up a text message automation to notify them in the morning about the current score of their followed stocks. The automation also gives the user the option of investing directly from text, if the stock is performing well. <br> 

### [WatchfulWiggles](https://devpost.com/software/seg-fault)

Watchful Wiggles will detect movement for a certain period of time, after that period has elapsed it will start recording, send an email/text notification to the user, and will save which device it came from at what time.  <br>
