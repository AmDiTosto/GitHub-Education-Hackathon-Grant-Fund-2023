> Provide a description of your event, including but _not_ limited to: <br>
 - October 7th - October 8th
 - The University of Texas at Arlington / Association for Computing Machinery
 - **The United States of America, Texas, Arlington**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
  - Our hackathon was unique because 
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
   - We createdd a point system that rewards people for participating in various activities like attending mini-events, workshops, getting meals, and staying overnight. These earned points can then be exchanged for cool prizes. This created a lot of enegament. For example, we had 500 people come to our event and about 170+ went to one of our workshops. We also had hungry hungry hippos this year and a mini event called battleship.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
   - We had a workshop over Git and GitHub in the beginning of our event.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - Who was the target audience for your event? <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
   - We used the grant funds by making sure we have options for people with dietary restrictions.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
   - The funds had a positive impact on the outcomes of our event participants by ensuring that everyone had enough food and energy to sustain their coding efforts. This also meant that participants didn't have to leave to get food, giving them more uninterrupted time to work on their projects.
- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.) 

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
We had a lot of cool projects. Here are some:
   - [Moist Meter](https://devpost.com/software/moist-meter-nj04ti): A web application integrated with a specialized sensor designed for use in wooden studs or drywall. It detects moisture in these materials by measuring the electrical conductivity created when moisture is present. It offers accurate moisture assessments and notifies users of potential issues through a user-friendly interface, along with suggested preventive actions.
   - [Amelia](https://devpost.com/software/blinkedin-mqo4rp): The app offers two key features. The primary feature analyzes data from State Farm safe driving sensors, including factors like cornering, speed, distance, and time, to assess if a user's vehicle needs maintenance. It sends users specific alerts and contact information for further inquiries if necessary. The secondary feature provides estimates for when specific parts need replacement based on typical service intervals and allows users to update their maintenance records, providing additional data for the model.
   - [Pear](https://devpost.com/software/pear-8ug17o): The app scans and monitors your groceries, offering estimated expiration dates and recipe suggestions based on your purchases. It provides nutritional information for recipes, including calorie counts and macronutrient content, along with allergen warnings and a nutritional score. The app also sends alerts for items approaching their expiration date, promoting efficient use of your groceries and reducing waste.
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
   - We required that all hackers use GitHub for project collaboration to facilitate transparency and monitor for any suspicious activity. For example, you can see our first-place winners, Moist Meter, who utilized GitHub for their project collaboration, by visiting this [link](https://github.com/jduhking/MoistMeter). You can also see another main track winner (Pear) using GitHub by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/jacky0ussef/hackUTA23). People link their GitHub profile on devpost, so you can see teams using GitHub for their project.
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
   - We've already provided the links under the section titled 'What were some of the coolest projects at your event?' However, these projects are special due to their innovative nature and the fact that they addressed problems we've never seen solved before.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
   - In HackUTA 2022, we had 325 participants, while in HackUTA 2023, the number increased to 484 participants. The number of teams on Devpost grew from 64 to 94 during the same period. Registration numbers also demonstrated significant growth, with about 700 registrants in 2022 and 1023 in 2023. This substantial growth has been made possible, in part, by the generous support of GitHub, which has allowed us to better accommodate individuals with dietary restrictions. UTA has a diverse community with varying dietary needs, and we are grateful for this support.
- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>
   - HackUTA 2024 will most likely be happening in October again. We have not finalized the dates.
