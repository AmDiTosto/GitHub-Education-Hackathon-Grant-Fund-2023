## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
  - Our hackathon was unique because 
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
   - We createdd a point system that rewards people for participating in various activities like attending mini-events, workshops, getting meals, and staying overnight. These earned points can then be exchanged for cool prizes. This created a lot of enegament. For example, we had 500 people come to our event and about 170+ went to one of our workshops. We also had hungry hungry hippos this year and a mini event called battleship.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
   - We had a workshop over git and github in the beginning of our event.
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>
