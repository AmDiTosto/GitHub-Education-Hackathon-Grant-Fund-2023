## Impact of GitHub Grant

- The Github Grant was used to support various aspects of our hackathon: from food, to transportation, to activity costs. Thanks to the Github Grant, we were able to have adequate funds to support our hackers during the weekend with quality food and transporting hackers outside of Western.
- The Github Grant largely aided us in providing a better food menu for our hackers, offer reimbursements to hackers who aren't able to use our provided busses, and minor budget contributions to day-of fun activities. Thanks to the grant, we were able to include more hackers from outside of citities where we provided transportation and have a diverse menu throughout out event for everyone to enjoy!
