# Hack_NCState 2023
 - **April 8-9, 2023** 
 - **North Carolina State University**
 - **Raleigh, NC, USA**  

## Event Summary

Hack_NCState 2023 was NC State's first general in-person hackathon since 2019 when COVID forced the event to go virtual for the past 3 years. Hack_NCState 2023 was a 24 hour sprint that included both novice and experienced hackers, allowing all participants to meet new friends, grow their technical and professional skills, and build innovative projects using cutting edge technologies. The event was a great success and included many intriguing events such as a competitive programming competition, technical workshops from our sponsors, and fun games (see our Midnight Easter Egg Hunt pics below)! Participants were required to use GitHub to submit their code for their projects. Some projects went above and beyond and used GitHub for project documentation and to host their sites!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

Hack_NCState was targeted towards hackers of all skills and backgrounds, aiming to provide a diverse and inclusive experience for all. High-schoolers are a demographic that are generally excluded from in-person events due to legal liability reasons, but we went the extra mile to make sure that they could attend Hack_NCState and get the full hackathon experience! 

In terms of gender parity from the participants who reported their gender, there were 66% male, 13% female, and 2% non-binary hackers. 20% chose not to answer.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White |

## Impact of GitHub Grant

The GitHub Grant funds were critical in ensuring we could provide our participants with the best experience possible given our tight budget this year. Specifically, we used the funds to purchase t-shirts for our participants. We plan to save the remaining 25% of funds to make Hack_NCState 2024 bigger and better by allowing us to support more participants.
