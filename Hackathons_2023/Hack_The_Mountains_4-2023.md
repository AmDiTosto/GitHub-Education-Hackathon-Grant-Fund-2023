## Impact of GitHub Grant
These funds were utilized at various places, let me list the same :

1. As mentioned we conduct a series of workshops called HTM Qubits, some of our workshops are in person, so funds are needed to secure the place, for refreshments for attendees and goodies.

2. We conduct many events before the hackathon to keep the engagement and hype of the hackathons, these events have some prizes so funds will be utilized here

3. As this is a in-person hackathon funds are very much needed for securing the venues, promotional materials, refreshments for attendees, and finally prizes.
