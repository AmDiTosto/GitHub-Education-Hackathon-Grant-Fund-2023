## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used the funds from Github to help organize our hackathon in the following ways:
*To cover the cost of renting a venue and equipment.
*To provide food and drinks for the participants.
*To offer prizes for the winners.
*To promote the event to a wider audience.

We believe that this grant had a significant impact on our event by helping us to attract more participants, provide a better experience for them, and ultimately make the event more successful.
