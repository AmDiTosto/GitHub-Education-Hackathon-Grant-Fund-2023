# MadHacks Fall 2023 Summary

November 11th - 12th, 2023
University of Wisconsin - Madison
Madison, WI, USA

## Event Summary

MadHacks Fall 2023 was hosted on the UW-Madison campus, and organized by UW undergraduates. What makes us unique is that we're one of the longest running hackathons on campus, and we don't restrict participants to a partiular theme/topic, although participants can submit their prizes to our company sponsor tracks with project categories.

Amid all the hacking, we put on workshops on html/css/js, web scraping, react, backend + databases, and a workshop designed to help first time hackers start a project. MLH also ran their painting with bob ross event. The most popular event of all was "Take a Break with Roblox", in which hackers could socialize with each other and the mentors from Roblox over a cup of boba from a local tea shop.

GitHub was featured in our event by sending out announcements to use the GitHub Student pack as well as having GitHub branded stickers throughout the event for participants to grab. One of the most popular features of the student pack that participants were using was GitHub Copilot, although it seemed to be used less than MadHacks in last spring, potentially since ChatGPT has gotten better and more widely used.

## Tech Impact / Diversity

MadHacks was recently restarted after covid last semester, and its goal was to be as enriching for people with less of a background in hackathons due to the pause of in person hackathons. We noticed last spring it was still sort of difficult to get help for beginners as there were less workshops ran, and we wanted to improve on that by running workshops into commonly used technologies and components of the tech stack which went great! We also wanted to better support beginners in terms of mentorship help but honestly that was super difficult to do this semester as due to the economic conditions it was harder to get sponsors as we heavily relied on sponsorship mentors for last spring's MadHacks, which we tried to fill in with organizers and other known community members. One thing we're planning for the next MadHacks is to look elsewhere for mentors as more mentors never hurts!

## Impact of GitHub Grant

Almost every team utilized GitHub to collaboratively and efficiently work on their projects over the 24-hours. The GitHub grant helped fund snacks and drinks throughout the event, which helped participants stay fueled, excited, and engaged.

## Top Projects

**1st Place** - [LeviTap](https://devpost.com/software/levitap). The team was inspired to create LeviTap because they felt that the traditional ways to navigate the computer are obsolete and limiting. THey wanted to create a solution that would allow them to control our devices more naturally and intuitively. They envision a future where everyone has access to touchless computer navigation technology. They believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and make them more accessible to everyone.

**2nd Place** - [EpiPal](https://devpost.com/software/epilocator). The team has family members with severe allergies. If they have an allergic reaction, and EpiPen could save their life. They almost always carry an EpiPen with them, but sometimes they forget. Their app tracks the locations of the nearest people who regularly carry EpiPens. When users log into the app, they indicate whether or not they carry an EpiPen and allow location sharing. If Users are ever in need of an EpiPen, they can declare an emergency which sends a notification to everyone in their immediate surroundings with information about where they are.

**3rd Place** - [NeuraCare](https://devpost.com/software/neuracare). In today's fast-paced world, providing personalized care for individuals with special healthcare needs, such as those with Alzheimer's, Dementia, or other cognitive challenges, can be a daunting task. Recognizing this need, we are excited to introduce Neuracare – a comprehensive healthcare platform that revolutionizes the way caregivers and patients interact and manage care.
