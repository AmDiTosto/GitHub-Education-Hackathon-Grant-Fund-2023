# MasseyHacks IX 
 
 - May 6-7, 2023
 - Vincent Massey Secondary School / MasseyHacks 
 - Windsor, Ontario, Canada  

## Event Summary

MasseyHacks is Canada's oldest and largest high school hackathon. This year, MasseyHacks IX was a 24-hour event which gave students the opportunity to explore the realm of computer science and bring their creative ideas to life by developing a project of their own. Regardless of their skill level, MasseyHacks invited anyone to join as a hacker to participate in workshops, engage in countless activities, and meet other like-minded students and gave them the resources to create a project they were passionate about! 

Along with a wide variety of workshops which helped students break the boundaries in the execution of their projects, MasseyHacks IX held an ample amount of fun activities to maintain a positive atomosphere which nurtered growth and community. Some of our workshops and activities included:
- Intro to Unity — Introduction to the concepts of an ECS based environment
- GitHub — Students learned how to create a repository in the cloud where each member of their group could push their code changes, and everyone had a copy of the same code on their own individual computers. Seasoned hackers learned about CI/CD pipelines. 
- Soldering — The instructors guided participants through the process and basic techniques of soldering through-hole electrical components. Students learned how to identify components and read PCB layouts, while using soldering tools. 
- Careers in Tech — A workshop and AMA with our Massey Alumnus!
- Karaoke — Participants took a well-deserved break to sing to their heart's content!
- Cup-stacking — This is a fundamental activity of MasseyHacks. Which team can stack the highest tower in the limited time?

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The grant funds helped us plan the best experience for students participating in MasseyHacks IX. We were able to purchase swag including shirts, stickers, magnets, and keychains for all the participants which will serve as a reminder of everything they learned from this event, and will remind then the importance of joining similar events in the future. Also, the funds helped fuel the hackers as they were provided with drinks, snacks, and meals throughout the two days which helped them focus on perfecting their project while learning from workshops and experienced mentors. 

Due to the grant funds, MasseyHacks IX ran smoothly, and participants gained the most out of this experience!
