# Morgan Hacks
 - **April 1st-2nd, 2023** 
 - **Morgan Hacks**
 - **Maryland, USA**  

## Event Summary
The inaugural MorganHacks hackathon event was held from 8am on Saturday the 1st of April to 7pm on Sunday, the 2nd of April. 

MorganHacks is a weekend- long hackathon that brings together hundreds of students from around the globe to work on innovative software and/or hardware projects. 

Students from different backgrounds were brought  to the campus of Morgan State University, **the largest HBCU in Maryland**, to collaborate and innovate as part of our aim to create ideas and initiatives that shape culture. This year, MorganHacks was held entirely in- person, and from the start, students were empowered with the resources to research and come up with exciting technology projects. The event was entirely student led. 

During MorganHacks we also hosted a list of exceptional Speakers that shared the wisdom of their journey and experience with the students. Our Keynote Speaker was Delali Dzirasa, CEO and Founder of Fearless. He discussed his personal experiences that led him to become successful, both as an innovator and an entrepreneur. MorganHacks also featured a panel of speakers which included Bianca J. Jackson Creative Experience Officer and Founder of BrickRose Exchange, Luke Lawal Jr. the CEO and founder of Hbcu Buzz and L & Company, Amber Takahashi, Founder of Brown Girl Tech world, and lastly Omi Bell, Serial Entrepreneur, Author and CEO of Black Girl Ventures. The panelists answered questions surrounding the tech space and entrepreneurship, and how students could navigate these terrain. 2

Morganhacks hosted several events for students in order to build technical skills and gain insight to become successful in the workforce. **There were eight workshops in total**. The first round of workshops included Ripple blockchain & XRPL training, Amazon: A Glimpse into Amazon Web Services, and lastly Bureau of Creative Intelligence, which did a training on Crafting a Metaverse Event. The second round of workshops included a  Microsoft information session on Power Platform App Maker, Black Venture Capital Consortium hosted a workshop on the Components of a Pitch, Goldman Sachs hosted an Engineering 101 informational session, and Major Hacking League hosted the MLH Cyber Security Challenge event. These events helped to prepare the participating students both for success in the hackathon, as well as their future endeavors.
