 - **29th September to 1st October , 2023** 
 - **Bhilai Institute Of Technology, Durg**
 - **Durg, Chhattisgarh, INDIA**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> OpInHacks 2023 marked the inaugural in-person MLH hackathon held in Chhattisgarh, offering a unique and novel experience for the residents of Durg and neighboring cities, who have had limited exposure to hackathons in their region. One distinguishing feature of our event was the presence of a diverse audience from across the length and breadth of India. Furthermore, we provided an exceptional opportunity for hackers to connect with and receive guidance from a panel of over 10 judges and mentors, making the event even more special and enriching.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br> It was a 36-hour long event so participants were bound to get exhausted but we kept them engaged with our fun and exciting mini events, workshops, Panel Discussion and social media challenges.<br>
Mini-events : Musical and Jamming nights<br>
Workshops : GitHub Codespaces Workshop, Quine Workshop<br>
For the social media challenge, we introduced social media challenges where hackers could win special goodies and t-shirts.<br>
We included a panel discussion featuring four of our mentors who shared invaluable insights from their personal journeys. Their discussions covered topics such as innovation, team building, enhancing the developer experience, and even entrepreneurship.

- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> During our event, we conducted a session on GitHub Codespaces, led by our GitHub Campus Expert, Sanskriti. In this informative session, attendees gained insights into the functionality of GitHub Codespaces. Furthermore, all 52 participating teams utilized GitHub as their platform for code submission. Our dedicated tech teams also extended their assistance to those who were less familiar with the intricacies of using GitHub, ensuring a smooth and inclusive experience for all participants.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - Who was the target audience for your event? <br> As this was the first time our college organized a hackathon, much less an MLH Hackathon, we focussed on the first-timers and how their first hackathon experience was going to be. We aimed at serving the beginners by providing them with a comfortable and welcoming environment so that they could learn and practice the skills needed for hacking. We also had special monetary Prize for teams with all female members.
 - What does the diversity breakdown look like? (Include the percentage of hackers who identify as female, non-binary or other) <br> The approx percentage of males was 76.70%, females was 23.29% and 0% for non-binary and others.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>First and foremost, we would like to thank GitHub Education Hackathon Grant Fund for accepting our application. With such a tight budget, GitHub grant helped us to arrange proper accommodation facilities like bedding, pillow and blanket for the hackers. We could also provide them an extra meal since our judging took a bit of extra time thanks to the grant. This grant also helped in improving hacker experience as the prize money could be increased which lured in more participants.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br> The fund's most significant positive contribution was the flexibility it provided for our meal budget. Due to the extended judging period, hackers became quite hungry, and thanks to the grant, we were able to confidently allocate additional resources to provide an extra meal for the hackers.


## Top Projects

- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br> GitHub was used to collaborate amongst the team members and used to host websites, using github pages. It was also handy to form organizations and host different repositories of one codebase. Participants also utilized GitHub for version control of the codebase.
- What made them special? <br> What made the winning teams stand out was that, unlike in many other hackathons where some projects are partially pre-made, all of our winning teams developed their projects exclusively within the 36-hour hackathon timeframe.

## What‚Äôs Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
Positives üëç<br>
Our team's spirit and management were greatly appreciated by the numerous participants. In every situation, our team remained composed and handled every assigned task with precision.
The food arrangements received high praise from the hackers, and they thoroughly enjoyed the meals.
The sessions we conducted on GitHub Codespaces and Quine during the hacking hours proved immensely helpful to the hackers, as they reached out to me personally to seek further clarification after the sessions.
The diverse audience and the exchange of ideas allowed students from our region to expand their horizons and build valuable networks.<br>
Negatives üëé<br>
On the first night, we faced an unexpected water supply issue within the building. Unfortunately, quick fixes weren't accessible at midnight (3:00 AM). To ensure sanitation needs were met, we promptly relocated participants to Computer Science block when necessary.
Due to budget constraints, we were unable to provide a continuous supply of tea or coffee. However, we did make it available three times a day.
A few teams backed off from the event without prior notice, which is something that can occur in any large gathering. It's common for a 100% attendance rate to not always be achievable.

- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br> We are planning to host OpInHacks 2024 in the summer of 2024
