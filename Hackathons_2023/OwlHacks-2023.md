## Event Summary

Our second hackathon in a year, OwlHacks, was a testament to our dedication to the hacker community. We witnessed an impressive increase in participation by over 100 participants, a clear indication of the event's growing popularity and impact.

Our carefully crafted workshops were a standout aspect of the event. Designed with a dual focus, they aimed to impart both hard and soft skills to the attendees. For those looking to immerse themselves in technical knowledge, the React workshop was the perfect fit. On the other hand, the career workshop was tailored to offer insights into the professional realm, aiding students in bridging the gap between academia and the industry.

But not all was work! Recognizing the importance of relaxation and rejuvenation during such intense events, we introduced the Bob Ross workshop where hackers followed along with a Bob Ross video, but had to use Microsoft Paint. This session, serving as a brain break, allowed participants to momentarily step away from the tech frenzy and engage in some fun art, channeling their inner Bob Ross.

A noteworthy addition was a speaker who delved into the specifics of the startup experience. This session, held in the SERC – a hub for many computer science classes at Temple University – offered students a window into the entrepreneurial world, enlightening them about the challenges and rewards of launching a startup.

GitHub remained at the heart of our hackathon, with students being encouraged to use the platform for their projects. This not only facilitated seamless collaboration but also ensured that their innovative solutions were accessible to the global community. And as a token of our appreciation for their involvement, participants were treated to a plethora of GitHub merchandise, which was received with immense enthusiasm.

## Impact of GitHub Grant

We used the GitHub Grant funds to help purchase food for hackers, ensuring they remained well-fed throughout the entire event. The funds helped our participants to focus more on hacking and less on other concerns, such as finding food.
