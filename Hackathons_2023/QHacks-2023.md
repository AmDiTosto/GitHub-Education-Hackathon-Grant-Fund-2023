 - January 27 to 29th, 2023

## Event Summary

- QHacks is Queen's University's one and only annual hackathon! We brought together a diverse group of hackers, speakers and mentors to create, learn and share their ideas! We gave participants the opportunity to attend workshops, take part in hacker challenges, meet industry professionals, and some new friends. We had some fun mini events like cup stacking and pong. Participants also enjoyed some delicious and meals ranging from Panera Bread to Chungchun Rice Dogs!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The GitHub grant proved to be incredibly valuable, as it not only helped us cover the cost of food for our hackers but also allowed us to provide transportation to those who needed to travel outside of Queen's University. With the funds, we were able to arrange for buses that transported our attendees safely and efficiently. This helped make the event more accessible and convenient for everyone involved, and we are grateful for the support that GitHub provided us. The grant enabled us to provide healthy and satisfying meals, accommodating various dietary requirements, ensuring that all participants were well-fed and energized throughout the event.
