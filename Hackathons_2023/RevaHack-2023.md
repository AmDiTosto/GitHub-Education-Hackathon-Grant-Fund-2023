## Event Summary

REVA HACK 2023 was a dynamic multi-track offline hackathon held at REVA University from November 2–4. This year, the event featured six distinct tracks: AR/VR, AI/ML, Cyber Security, Blockchain, IoT & Cloud, and Open Innovation.

During the intense 36-hour competition, students brainstormed and offered innovative solutions centered around our theme, "Technology Beyond Imagination." 

The event garnered substantial interest, with over 1200 registrations. Notably, more than 230 participants were selected to attend the event physically, showcasing their enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving.

To kickstart the hackathon, we organized informative "Pre-hackathon Sessions" on the first day. Seasoned experts from various tech giants and veteran hackers shared their insights and experiences with our aspiring hackers.

Throughout the event, mini-events featuring diverse challenges and prizes were held, creating an engaging environment for participating hackers.

A significant portion of our hackers utilized Github for collaboration, fostering teamwork among members. Additionally, a mandatory requirement for all participants was the possession of a Github repository. This was essential for monitoring the progress and ensuring originality, helping us in the prevention of plagiarism.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Due to unforeseen delays, we encountered issues in receiving the GitHub Grant funds on time. Although the funds were not accessible as planned, our event was in need of financial support for critical areas. The intended utilization of the grant funds, once received, is primarily aimed to cover expenses for snacks and additional refreshments for our participating hackers and judges, along with managing the costs associated with photography and videography services. These areas were vital to enhance the overall experience and documentation of the event. We had strategized to allocate the funds for these specific purposes to ensure a successful and enriched hackathon experience for all participants.
