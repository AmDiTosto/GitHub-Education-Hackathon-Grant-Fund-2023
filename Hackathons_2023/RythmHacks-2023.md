## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used the GitHub grant funds to buy snacks and beverages for the participants, which was vital in keeping participants refreshed and energized. We recieved a lot of positive feedback regarding snacks: snacks were plentiful, tasty, and easy to access. Any remaining funds were put towards future events. In general, the GitHub grant provided a huge boost in event quality and hacker experience.
