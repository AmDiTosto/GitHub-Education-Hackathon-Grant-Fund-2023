## Top Projects

- Lambda Protocol is a decentralized, peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform that utilizes AI and blockchain technology to incentivize good behavior and moderate content. The platform was built using a distributed database with a relay server, Ethereum blockchain for rewards, and openai for moderation, and React for the front end. Check it out [here](https://devpost.com/software/lambda-protocol)
- Wireless Walker is a device that uses ultrasonic sensors and a mobile app to aid visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles while walking. The device eliminates the need for the cane to touch the ground and provides audio directions to the user. The team used Arduino microcontrollers and sensors to build the prototype and overcame challenges with limited resources. The team plans to improve the hardware and software of the device in future iterations. Check it out [here](https://devpost.com/software/wireless-walker)
