# TechTogether Miami 2023
 - **May 5-6, 2023** 
 - **Miami Dade College**
 - **Miami, Florida, USA**  

## Event Summary

- TechTogether focuses on redefining the hacker stereotype by focus on supporting marginalized genders. TechTogether events are across the US, with local organizers in each chapter forging the path for the planning and execution of the event. TechTogether Miami was at Miami Dale College, and was a weekend full of learning and creating projects that hackers were passionate about. This event was more difficult in particular due to venue rules and restrictions, but the team worked together so that hackers had the best experience they could while there.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Education Grant helped cover the cost of food for the event. The venue had rules on where hackers could eat, and having good meals was important so that hackers were fueled over the weekend.
