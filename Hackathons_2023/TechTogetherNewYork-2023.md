## Event Summary

TechTogether focuses on redefining the hacker stereotype by focus on supporting marginalized genders. TechTogether events are across the US, with local organizers in each chapter forging the path for the planning and execution of the event. TechTogether Seattle was at St. John's University, and was a weekend full of learning and creating projects that hackers were passionate about. This event had a special cybersecurity focus, with a demo of the lab at St. John's!

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
These funds directly impacted the ability of the event to get food that met the dietary restrictions of hackers. There were hackers who did not fill out their registration form correctly so we had to get unplanned meals to cover their dietary restrictions the day of the event.
