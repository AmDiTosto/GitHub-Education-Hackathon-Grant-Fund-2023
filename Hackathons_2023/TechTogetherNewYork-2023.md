# TechTogether New York
 - **May 27-28, 2023** 
 - **St. John's University**
 - **Jamaica, New York, USA**  

## Event Summary

TechTogether focuses on redefining the hacker stereotype by focus on supporting marginalized genders. TechTogether events are across the US, with local organizers in each chapter forging the path for the planning and execution of the event. TechTogether Seattle was at St. John's University, and was a weekend full of learning and creating projects that hackers were passionate about. This event had a special cybersecurity focus, with a demo of the lab at St. John's! There was also specifically an Intro to Git Workshop, which highlighted how to use git and how to use GitHub desktop to collaborate with team members.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
These funds directly impacted the ability of the event to get food that met the dietary restrictions of hackers. There were hackers who did not fill out their registration form correctly so we had to get unplanned meals to cover their dietary restrictions the day of the event.
