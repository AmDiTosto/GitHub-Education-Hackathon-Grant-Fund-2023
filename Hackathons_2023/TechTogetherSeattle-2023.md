## Event Summary

TechTogether focuses on redefining the hacker stereotype by focus on supporting marginalized genders.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
These funds helped cover the cost of dietary restriction meals the day of the event. The catering had ham sandwiches touching the vegetarian meals, making them non halal, so we ordered meals day of to make sure hackers still had food. We also had more hackers than anticipated based on registration, so went to Costco on Saturday to get more snacks for hackers.
