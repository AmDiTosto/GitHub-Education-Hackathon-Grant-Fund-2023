# Treasure Hacks 3.5

**April 28 - 30, 2023**
**Treasure Hacks**
**(Online) United States, California, Irvine**

## Event Summary

Treasure Hacks 3.5 was an online Generative AI & Blockchain themed hackathon dedicated to teaching new hackers how to
develop with these novel technologies. At our event, we featured a "Best General Hack" which was meant to attract
hackers who just wanted to make a general project, but our goal was to inspire these participants to build with the
theme.

Additionally, we strive to give feedback to all of our hackers so we require our judges to give comments in every rubric
category for each judged project. Then we manually DM-ed all the results to our participants. Even for participants who
accidently didn't turn in their project, we got our team together to judge them and give them feedback.

Some of our most interesting workshops featured the CTO & Co-Founder of Eden AI who talked about Using Generative Models 
More Reliably, both a Generative AI and Blockchain involved professionals hosting Q&A sessions, and a Chat GPT workshop.

We also tried something different and hosted a "Custom Logo Creation" event where students can come by and ask our 
Lead Designer, Madison Plotkins, to create a logo for them. It seemed like this was a huge hit because a ton of
participants gave a huge thank you to her afterwards :)

In Treasure Hacks 3.5, we featured GitHub by requiring all probjets to have a GitHub Repository,
had a GitHub 101 Workshop, and personally taught new hackers how to use GitHub.

## Impact of GitHub Grant

We used the GitHub Grant funds to get more participant space in our discord "Amphitheater," marketing to participants, 
and prizes to motivate participants. 

As mentioned in our grant application, the majority of these funds did go to our prizes because we wished
to promote a culture that rewards hard work, creativity, and collaboration. The first two is shown through
our participant's amazing projects along with our high percentage of students who built projects. Almost all
the students who attended the event (around 95%) went forward to build projects. Those who were initially not
planning to do this was guided through the process by our fantastic community managers.

We additionally had our "Most Helpful Award" rewards the hacker that helps the most amount of other participants 
in their projects and answering questions. The winner of this prize had a wopping 620 messages and helped
multiple participants in calls.

## Top Projects


**Sight Sense (Best Generative AI Hack)**

Your Third Eye - Empowering the visually impaired

Overall just a fantastic project. Not only did they create a hardware hack (for a virtual event) but had an
amazing pitch video with 10/10 editting that all of our judges complimented in our comments. Our team describes
it as "Google glasses"


**Gatery (Best Blockchain Hack)**

Create NFT tokengated content experiences for anything

Personally I was amazed at this project because it developed a technology that I recently saw my uncle developing
under his new company. Unfornately, he has not finished the product yet, but this participant did, and in 32-hours!
Incredible.


**ExamGazette (Best General Hack)**

We're super happy that we had a "General Hack" category because it some of our new hackers to win a category!
They were super active in our community, attending workshops, getting help from mentors, we're so glad that their
effort paid off.


**"Recycling and storytelling come alive!" (Incredible project made by a 6-year-old)**
Idea is to merge 2 interesting games, i.e. recycling quiz & a word association or Madlib game, the project helps 
to learn about recycling & the environment more fun and interactive like an AI bot.

This was by far the most shocking project. Our team was honored to have such a young hacker at our event and be the
intro into GitHub for her. Our judges absolutely loved her and so did our team! If you want to check out some fun
videos that her mom sent to us afterwards, they're linked below.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
Overall, to be frank, we didn't get as many participants as we wanted. However, after the initial low, we were so excited
to see such great activity from these hackers with the amount of projects we received! Traditionally, we've seen around
25-40% of hackers make projects (in online hackathons) but to have almost 95% and for a topics as complex as Generative
AI and Blockchain, we were overjoyed. I think that for future events, we need to time our events better because the event
landed right on mid-term season for college.

We plan to host an in-person University of California: San Diego Hack on January 19-21.
