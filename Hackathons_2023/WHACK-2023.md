# WHACK
WHACK is Wellesley College's annual hackathon. 
We welcome any undergraduate college students ages 18 and above to join us for a weekend of innovation, learning, sharing ideas, and forming new connections!
WHACK started on November 4th, 2023 and ended on November 5th, 2023. 

## Event Summary

Since WHACK is organized by Wellesley College (a historically women's college), WHACK usually has a significant 
number of female and non-binary students who are interested in SWE/other areas of computer science! WHACK is also 
a primarily beginner-friendly hackathon and encourage those who have not had a lot of experience with coding to 
get their feet wet through our mini-events/workshops/mentorship opportunities. 
Some events that we had this year included: "Workshop: Building Accessible UI with React Spectrum", "Break Through Tech AI Info Session", 
"Workshop in Non-Tech Opportunities in the Industry", "Workshop: Intro to Figma and Interactive Design", "Workshop: Intro to Databases and SQL", 
and the Bob Ross MLH mini decompressing event. 
GitHub was featured on our website as well as in our Opening and Closing ceremony slides.
