# {WildHacks}

- **April 15-16, 2023**
- **Northwestern University**
- **Evanston, IL, USA**

## Event Summary

WildHacks is Northwestern's overnight Hackathon and is an opportunity for students to learn programming skills and develop a final project in a collaborative and inclusive environment. This year, we hosted various workshops on topics such as Intro to WebDev, Intro to GitHub, Using the GPT-3 API, and more! Additionally, during our event we had activities like a hand-brain chess tournament, Kahoot trivia, and more.

We featured Github at WildHacks by having a beginner friendly GitHub tutorial and featured GitHub at our event by having all project submissions include a GitHub repository link. This allowed our hackers to work collaboratively and ensure they had version control!

## Tech Impact / Diversity

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

- Who was the target audience for your event? <br>
Our target audience was hackers in the Chicago-land area. We wanted to be welcoming to all identities! We had roughly 30% of Woman and Non-Binary hackers, and hope to maintain and increase this percentage in future events. 

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- The GitHub Grant Funds were used to cover snacks for our hackers! Including healthy options like bananas and oranges, and late night Insomnia Cookies.
- These funds ensured that our hackers were able to stay satiated and focused, and also helped them stay motivated to remain at our in-person venue to receive the midnight snack, Insomnia cookies!
- We greatly appreciate GitHub's support in helping us provide healthy snacks for our hundreds of participants.
