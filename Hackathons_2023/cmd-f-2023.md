# cmd-f 2023
> cmd-f is a hackathon focused on addressing gender inequality in technology. Our main purpose is to create a safe, dedicated space for people who face gender inequalities to hack together. <br>

## Event Summary

At nwPlus, we are committed to fostering a network that encourages innovation, inclusivity, and learning among those interested in tech. We believe that hackathons are for everyone, no matter what you study, where you’re from, or your previous experiences. cmd-f is our hackathon for underrepresented gender where hundreds of hackers, mentors, and sponsors gather together for an unforgettable weekend. After 2 years of online iterations, we were finally able to return in person for cmd-f 2023! Before the hackathon, our organizers hosted workshops like Intro to Hackathons, Design, Web Development, and React to help our hackers prepare for cmd-f. During the hackathon, we had sponsor workshops, a keynote panel, fireside chats, a Tetris tournament, a pilates session, a self-defence workshop, MLH cup stacking, 3AM noodles, and midnight karaoke to keep our hackers entertained throughout the weekend.

GitHub was integral in the success of cmd-f. Not only did the grant help us tremendously, GitHub was our hackers' VCS of choice, helping hackers collaborate on their projects with their groups.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - We're trying to create access for people who have historically been excluded. We have encouraged participation from women, trans people, non-binary individuals, and other gender-diverse people. Thus, cmd-f was only open to individuals that identify as an underrepresented gender in technology. We're aware that gender is not the only inequality in technology. We appreciate allyship and recognize it is important in the community. We asked our allies to show their support by not hacking but helping in other forms, such as volunteering or mentoring.


### Where were your hackers from?

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant was extremely helpful since it help pay for food for our hackers, resulting in us being able to afford healthy, nutritious, and delicious food! In addition, the additional funds allowed us to accomodate all of our hackers' dietary restrictions, ensuring that everyone was very well-fed.
