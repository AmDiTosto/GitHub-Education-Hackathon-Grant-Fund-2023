# hackTAMS 2023
 <br>

#### January 28 - 29, 2023
#### Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science
#### Denton, TX, USA  

## Event Summary

hackTAMS was a 24-hour, hybrid hackathon filled with insightful guest speakers, educational workshops, and fun mini-events.
<br>
Throughout the hackathon, we hosted multiple guest speaker events featuring distinguished representatives from tech companies which allowed hackers to gain insight into tech industry work-life while also learning more about empathy in tech, human-centered AI, and the difference between academia and industry. Furthermore, we also hosted a Q&A panel with college admissions officers where hackers could gain a better understanding of the various computer science related opportunities and resources offered in college. During hackTAMS, we also hosted introductory artificial intelligence and cybersecurity workshops to help both beginner and advanced hackers expand their toolkit for project building. Lastly, to provide hackers an opportunity to destress and interact with others, we also hosted a cup stacking contest and a Just Dance competition.

## Tech Impact / Diversity

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
With a limited number of hackathons targeting novice high-school computer scientists in the DFW metroplex, hackTAMS strove to fill the void. Around 70% of our participants were first-time hackers, and, through our event, they were able to gain insight into what a future in computer science could look like through the informational college panel, guest speakers, and workshops. Additionally, through our mentors, first-time hackers were able to receive real-time support and feedback while working on their projects.
<br>
Hoping to bridge the gender gap in computer science as well, hackTAMS achieved a gender parity of 55% men and 45% women.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Our event would not have been possible without help from the Github Grant. With the Github Grant, we were able to supply all of our participants with t-shirts and stickers. Additionally, we were able to allocate some of the grant money towards providing hackers with free meals. Without the Github Grant, our budget would have been extremely tight, and we would only have been able to fully provide for a limited number of participants.

## What‚Äôs Next?
hackTAMS is an annual hackathon, and its 2023 iteration has been its largest iteration thus far. This year, we were able to host hackTAMS as a 24 hour hackathon that was open to all students in the DFW metroplex and beyond as opposed to the previous 12 hour events that were only open to students from TAMS. This milestone could not have been achieved without support from Github. Thus, in future iterations of hackTAMS, we hope to continue partnering with Github and growing our event to impact even more aspiring computer scientists.
