# nwHacks 2023

nwPlus hosted nwHacks 2023 from Jan 21-22, 2023 at the University of British Columbia.

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 

At nwPlus, we are committed to fostering a network that encourages innovation, inclusivity, and learning among those interested in tech. We believe that hackathons are for everyone, no matter what you study, where you’re from, or your previous experiences. nwHacks is our largest hackathon where hundreds of hackers, mentors, and sponsors gather together for an unforgettable weekend.
nwHacks is Western Canada's largest hackathon, and this year we were able to return in-person after 3 years! Before the hackathon, our organizers hosted workshops like Intro to Design, Web Dev, and React to help our hackers prepare for nwHacks. During the hackathon, we had events like a Tetris tournament, MLH cup stacking, and midnight karaoke to keep our hackers entertained throughout the weekend.

GitHub was integral in the success of nwHacks. Not only did the grant help us tremendously, GitHub was our hackers' VCS of choice, helping hackers collaborate on their projects with their groups.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
The GitHub grant was extremely helpful since it help pay for food for our hackers, resulting in us being able to afford healthy, nutritious, and delicious food! In addition, the additional funds allowed us to accomodate all of our hackers' dietary restrictions, ensuring that everyone was very well-fed.
