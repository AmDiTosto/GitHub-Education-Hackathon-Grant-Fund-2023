# The GitHub Education Hackathon Grant Fund 2022-2024
# Hack@Brown 2024
 - **February 3-4, 2024** 
 - **Brown University**
 - **Providence, Rhode Island**  

## Event Summary
In an industry that can often be highly competitive and intimidating (especially to those coming from underrepresented backgrounds), we hope that Hack@Brown helps create an experience that both introduces opportunities in technology, and inspires confidence in our hackers. 

Throughout the weekend, we've offered our participants numerous opportunities to learn and get excited about technology:

  - On Saturday, we had our Sponsorships Fair where hackers had a chance to meet representatives from our amazing sponsors.
  - Hackers attended numerous workshops throughout the weekend, about Python and Web Scraping, React and UI/UX and even Deep Learning. We've also had two interesting panels which led to fruitful discussions: an alumni panel and an AI/ML panel with industry professionals. 
  - Our MLH representatives also organized two amazing workshops, about GitHub Copilot and Soroban.

We had a GitHub Copilot Workshop on Saturday, "Making Better Hacks, Faster with GitHub Copilot". We've also given a shoutout to GitHub during our opening ceremony for their generous help through the grant. We've also given extensive support to hackers for learning how to use version control and collaborate with Git, using GitHub. <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
First and foremost, we would not have been able to host Hack@Brown 2024 and give a high quality experience to all of our hackers if we did not have the support of the GitHub grant. We mostly used the funds for food and facilities costs. More specifically, we were able to afford enough food so that all of our hackers who came to get lunch, dinner, a midnight snack, and brunch were able to get fed and stay energized throughout the weekend. Secondly, we faced some unexpected facilities costs from our university and were able to use the grant funds to ensure that we could cover such—this way our venue stayed clean throughout the hackathon and there were surge protectors set up for all of our hackers to charge their devices while developing their projects and pitching during judging. With all of this said, the GitHub Grant gave us that last mile support so that we could put on a great 10th year of Hack@Brown!

Our Favorite Projects:

We would like to highlight CosmoCrops and Lingualens (linked above) as they show the impressive breadth of projects that we had at Hack@Brown this year. More often than not, we do not get as many projects that are hardware or design focused, but both of these, among others, were and were very high quality projects. Further, one project we really enjoyed which did not win a prize was [Expanse](https://devpost.com/software/expanse), which allows everyone to build immersive 3D spaces, no matter their technical level of expertise. This was yet another project that explored a niche area, AR/VR, that is uncommon to come across during a hackathon. Further, we thought that this product was interesting given the recent release of the Apple Vision Pro and the continued investment into the Meta Quest 3. 

In terms of GitHub use at Hack@Brown, almost all of our hackers used GitHub for version control and collaboration throughout the weekend. Further, during our pre-Hack@Brown workshop, we encouraged hackers to take advantage of GitHub's Student Developer Pack when scoping out which technologies they want to use for their project. Lastly, our MLH coach hosted a workshop on using GitHub Copilot as a student.

## What’s Next?
This was the 10th year of hosting Hack@Brown, Brown University's annual hackathon, and we're so happy with how it turned out! We were generally proud of how smoothly the hackathon flowed, which was the result of organizational optimizations that we implemented for this year. We also were suprised by the interest surronding Hack@Brown, as we received over 1,000 registrations for the hackathon, up 45% from Hack@Brown 2023. Further, we were generally pleased with the hackathon attendance at around ~350 hackers, who represented 32 universities. We were especially impressed by the projects at Hack@Brown this year, which showcased incredible breadth and creativity, two of Brown's signature traits :). Looking to the future, we hope to find unconventional ways to fundraise, such as grants and alumni, and add in a short application process for those hoping to attend from other universities. We are planning to hold Hack@Brown 2025 during the last week of January or first week of February. We are excited to see Hack@Brown continue to create space for building and pitching technical projects on Brown's campus!
