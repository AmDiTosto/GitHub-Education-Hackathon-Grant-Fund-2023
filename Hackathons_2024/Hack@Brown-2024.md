## Impact of GitHub Grant
First and foremost, we would not have been able to host Hack@Brown 2024 and give a high quality experience to all of our hackers if we did not have the support of the GitHub grant. We mostly used the funds for food and facilities costs. More specifically, we were able to afford enough food so that all of our hackers who came to get lunch, dinner, a midnight snack, and brunch were able to get fed and stay energized throughout the weekend. Secondly, we faced some unexpected facilities costs from our university and were able to use the grant funds to ensure that we could cover such—this way our venue stayed clean throughout the hackathon and there were surge protectors set up for all of our hackers to charge their devices while developing their projects and pitching during judging. With all of this said, the GitHub Grant gave us that last mile support so that we could put on a great 10th year of Hack@Brown!

Our Favorite Projects:
We would like to highlight CosmoCrops and Lingualens (linked above) as they show the impressive breadth of projects that we had at Hack@Brown this year. More often than not, we do not get as many projects that are hardware or design focused, but both of these, among others, were and were very high quality projects. Further, one project we really enjoyed which did not win a prize was [Expanse](https://devpost.com/software/expanse), which allows everyone to build immersive 3D spaces, no matter their technical level of expertise. This was yet another project that explored a niche area, AR/VR, that is uncommon to come across during a hackathon. Further, we thought that this product was interesting given the recent release of the Apple Vision Pro and the continued investment into the Meta Quest 3. 

In terms of GitHub use at Hack@Brown, almost all of our hackers used GitHub for version control and collaboration throughout the weekend. Further, during our pre-Hack@Brown workshop, we encouraged hackers to take advantage of GitHub's Student Developer Pack when scoping out which technologies they want to use for their project. Lastly, our MLH coach hosted a workshop on using GitHub Copilot as a student.
