# Hack_NCState 2024
 - **Feb 3rd - 4th** 
 - **North Carolina State University**
 - **United States, North Carolina, Raleigh**  

## Event Summary

- This year we collaborated with Code Black, a student organization aiming to promote diversity and cultural awareness in Computer
Science. Code Black added a track to our event titled "Preserving Black Culture", where projects aimed to spread awareness and educate
people about culture. By having this track in our event, a diverse group of students were able to tackle different problems revolving around
diversity in Computer Science while learning things about Black Culture that they might not have known about previously.
- We had 5 workshops this year: Collaboration/Professional Networking Talk with Cisco, Research/AI Talk with Microsoft, UI/UX Talk with Code Black,
and an AI/ML Talk with Google. Alongside these workshops, we had a Career Panel with all of our Sponsors and Partners where participants
were able to ask questions about the tech industry.
- All particpants submitted their projects using GitHub. Also, since we had many first-time hackers, our mentors were encouraged
to teach participants how to use GitHub if they had never used it before.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 - Who was the target audience for your event? <br>
 - Hack_NCState is open to all students in either college or high school. We heavily advertise on NC State campus, however we try to get students from all over the country to attend! We had students from multiple colleges and high schools from many states in attendance for Hack_NCState 2024.
 - What does the diversity breakdown look like? (Include the percentage of hackers who identify as female, non-binary or other) <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
The grant was used for food and prizes, as well as some extra supplies we needed throughout the weekend to keep hackers
hydrated, fed, and awake!
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
This year Hack_NCState had double the participants compared to last year, so the funds helped us handle the large
 food and supplies requirements that we had! Only a week before the event we had to order food worth about 120 more meals,
and this grant helped pay for that extra expense we weren't anticipating. Without this extra order, we would not have been able to feed all of the participants! 

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
We had a project called Recyclopedia that used AI to recommend new and interesting ways to recycle any type of item yourself,
while also providing options on how to recycle it through a service or other company. Another project, VR Museum, presented Black History in a VR format to teach the user about some interesting facts they may not have known in an interactive way. Finally, we had a project called Loops, which was a pair of glasses that used Voice-To-Text functionality to transcribe
what someone else was saying and display that on the glasses.
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
All hackers submitted their project code on GitHub!
- What made them special? <br>
The projects at Hack_NCState were wide-ranging in the tech used and the problems that were being worked on. It was exciting to see how many people wanted to learn more about other cultures in our Preserving Black Culture track, and there were many creative ideas in our Life Cycle track that the judges thought were unique!
 - All of the projects and their writeups are available on our Devpost!

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- Hack_NCState 2024 was our second year back as an in-person hackathon, and it was bigger and better in many ways. At the same time, there are still many ways in which we can improve our event in terms of hacker participation, sponsor involvement, and overall experience! Overall, the Hack_NCState team is super happy with how the event went, and we enjoyed seeing the many awesome projects that were submitted.
- Our next event will likely be in April of next year
