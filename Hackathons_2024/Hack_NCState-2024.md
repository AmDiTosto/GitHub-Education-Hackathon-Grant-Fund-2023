# Hack_NCState 2024
 - **Feb 3rd - 4th** 
 - **North Carolina State University**
 - **United States, North Carolina, Raleigh**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
This year we collaborated with Code Black, a student organization aiming to promote diversity and cultural awareness in Computer
Science. Code Black added a track to our event titled "Preserving Black Culture", where projects aimed to spread awareness and educate
people about culture. By having this track in our event, a diverse group of students were able to tackle different problems revolving around
diversity in Computer Science while learning things about Black Culture that they might not have known about previously.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
- We had 5 workshops this year: Collaboration/Professional Networking Talk with Cisco, Research/AI Talk with Microsoft, UI/UX Talk with Code Black,
and an AI/ML Talk with Google. Alongside these workshops, we had a Career Panel with all of our Sponsors and Partners where participants
were able to ask questions about the tech industry.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
- All particpants submitted their projects using GitHub. Also, since we had many first-time hackers, our mentors were encouraged
to teach participants how to use GitHub if they had never used it before. 
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
The grant was used for food and prizes, as well as some extra supplies we needed throughout the weekend to keep hackers
hydrated, fed, and awake!
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
This year Hack_NCState had double the participants compared to last year, so the funds helped us handle the large
 food and supplies requirements that we had! Only a week before the event we had to order food worth about 120 more meals,
and this grant helped pay for that extra expense we weren't anticipating. Without this extra order, we would not have been able to feed all of the participants! 

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
We had a project called Recyclopedia that used AI to recommend new and interesting ways to recycle any type of item yourself,
while also providing options on how to recycle it through a service or other company. Another project, VR Museum, presented Black History in a VR format to teach the user about some interesting facts they may not have known in an interactive way. Finally, we had a project called Loops, which was a pair of glasses that used Voice-To-Text functionality to transcribe
what someone else was saying and display that on the glasses.
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
All hackers submitted their project code on GitHub!
- What made them special?
All of the projects and their writeups are available on our Devpost!
