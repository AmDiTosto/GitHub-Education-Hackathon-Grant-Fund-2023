## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
This year we collaborated with Code Black, a student organization aiming to promote diversity and cultural awareness in Computer
Science. Code Black added a track to our event titled "Preserving Black Culture", where projects aimed to spread awareness and educate
people about culture. By having this track in our event, a diverse group of students were able to tackle different problems revolving around
diversity in Computer Science while learning things about Black Culture that they might not have known about previously.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
- We had 5 workshops this year: Collaboration/Professional Networking Talk with Cisco, Research/AI Talk with Microsoft, UI/UX Talk with Code Black,
and an AI/ML Talk with Google. Alongside these workshops, we had a Career Panel with all of our Sponsors and Partners where participants
were able to ask questions about the tech industry.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
- All particpants submitted their projects using GitHub. Also, since we had many first-time hackers, our mentors were encouraged
to teach participants how to use GitHub if they had never used it before. 
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>
