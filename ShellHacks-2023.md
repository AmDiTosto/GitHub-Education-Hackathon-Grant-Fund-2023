## Event Summary

ShellHacks 2023 is a 36-hour event hosted on September 15th-17th, it is Florida's biggest hackathon and has been celebrating over 7 years of success. It has participants from all
over Florida as well as all over the United States come together and participate in this grand event. Hosted by a student org with advice from previous ShellHacks directors it
is an event focused on helping minorities break into tech as a beginner-friendly event, focusing on educating and allowing hackers to connect to a variety of companies. We held
a variety of company workshops, intro to various technologies to help give ideas of what hackers can do, as well as fun activities and informative panels by our alumni on what its
like to work in the tech industry. We had a smash tournament that lasted 3 hours late at night and was a huge hit with the participants, it was a nice distraction from coding, as well
as a scavenger hunt organized by another club in our school to get hackers active for an hour.

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
- Some of the coolest projects were Chess 10, Quackademy VR and Nearus
- They were unique in the way that they did their projects, Chess 10 had a site where they made 3d chess from scratch with good design, a login system as well, and an online match-finding server to play against other. Quackademy was a way to use VR in a learning enviroment and have students interact in that enviroment with teachers to learn and ask
  quetions while nearus, used gps and event data to find events near the user and would give details and costs for the user to see.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
-Overall ShellHacks was a big accomplishment, though there were some hiccups in the end we were able to give the hackers a great experience. More people than we expected
joined and we had hundreds of participants, it was a weekend of low sleep, lots of hacking as well, and many opportunities for hackers to learn about and talk to the 
companies that sponsored us this year. Though there were some hiccups that occurred we look forward to improving next year and bringing a great experience to hackers in 2024! <br>
- Next Year ShellHacks will be sometime in September<br>
